 1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
 1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving

 2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
 2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
 2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which

 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
 6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
 6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
 6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
 6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
 6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
 6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt

 7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
 7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
 7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
 7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
 7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
 7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
 7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
 7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,

 7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
 7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
 7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
 7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
 7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
 7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
 7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty

 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
 8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16
 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,
 8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of

 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and

 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
 9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
 9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall

 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
 9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in
 9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9
 9:9 And
 9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
 9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that
 9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which
 9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
 9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
 9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
 9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
 9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
 9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
 9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
 9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
 9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
 9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and
 10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
 10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
 10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

 10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
 10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
 10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
 10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
 10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
 10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
 10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16
 10:16 And the

 10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
 10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
 10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for
 10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
 10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
 10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
 11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
 11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of

 11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25
 11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
 11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
 11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
 11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s
 11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
 12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all
 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
 12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
 12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
 12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
 12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
 12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
 12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
 12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
 13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
 13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
 13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
 13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
 13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
 13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
 13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
 13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
 14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
 14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
 14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
 14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
 14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
 14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and
 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
 14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
 14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
 15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,
 15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
 15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
 15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
 15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
 15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
 16:1 Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an
 16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained
 16:3 And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
 16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do
 16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
 16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither
 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
 16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name,
 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
 17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared
 17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
 17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4
 17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
 17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
 17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and
 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall
 17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
 17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
 17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
 17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
 17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
 17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
 17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
 17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,
 18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
 18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed
 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
 18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
 18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
 18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
 18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
 18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
 18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
 18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet
 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
 19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of

 19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19
 19:19 Behold now,
 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

 19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou
 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
 20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and
 20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
 20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
 20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where
 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a

 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
 21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear
 21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should

 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of
 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
 21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
 21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,
 21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
 21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
 21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him
 21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.
 21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
 21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
 21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,
 21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou

 22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;
 22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and
 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
 22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay
 22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
 22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind

 24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
 24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
 24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
 24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well

 24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
 24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
 24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
 24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these

 24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
 24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
 24:34 And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
 24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
 24:36 And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was
 24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
 24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and
 24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not

 24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
 24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
 24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
 24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
 24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
 24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be

 27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
 27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
 27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s

 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
 28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD
 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is

 29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
 29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
 29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
 29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered

 29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
 29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years
 29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
 29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto

 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
 29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel
 29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be

 30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
 30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
 30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
 30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
 30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
 30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
 30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
 30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
 30:36 And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
 30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
 30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the

 30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
 31:1 And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
 31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
 31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
 31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
 31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
 31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
 31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
 31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
 31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that
 31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
 31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
 31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
 31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he

 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
 31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
 31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven

 31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the

 31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou
 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
 31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
 31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before
 31:33 And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into
 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s
 31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
 31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
 31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
 31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
 31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
 31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
 31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
 31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
 31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and
 31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
 31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
 31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
 31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this
 31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
 31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
 31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
 31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
 31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and
 32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
 32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he
 32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
 32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy

 32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
 32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
 32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
 32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came
 32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove
 32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
 32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
 32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For
 32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
 32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
 32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
 32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
 32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
 32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:
 32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
 32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
 32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
 32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
 33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,
 33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
 33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground
 33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,
 33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
 33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
 33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:
 33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And
 33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
 33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
 33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because
 33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
 33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
 33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
 33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
 33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made

 34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his
 34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
 34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:
 34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
 34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,
 34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
 34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
 34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
 34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
 34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
 34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
 34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will
 34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
 34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had

 34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
 34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
 34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:
 35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
 35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
 35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
 35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
 35:8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath

 35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
 35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
 35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
 35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,

 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
 37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
 37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
 37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
 37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
 37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
 37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
 37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
 37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock
 37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with
 37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
 37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,
 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
 37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
 37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
 37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
 37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this
 37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
 37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
 37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
 37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
 37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in
 37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
 37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast
 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
 37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
 37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
 38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
 38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
 38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
 38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
 38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
 38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
 38:7 And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
 38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and
 38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
 38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
 38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died;
 38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up
 38:14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her
 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she
 38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,
 38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and
 38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
 38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
 38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also
 38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
 38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
 38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
 38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
 38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
 38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his

 39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD
 39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
 39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
 39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not
 39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife
 39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my
 39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
 39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
 39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
 39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The

 39:20 And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a
 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
 39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
 39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
 40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
 40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
 40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
 40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
 40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
 40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
 40:7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of
 40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
 40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
 40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
 40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
 40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,
 40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and
 40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
 41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
 41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
 41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
 41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
 41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears
 41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
 41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
 41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
 41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
 41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
 41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
 41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there
 41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall
 41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon
 41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
 41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
 41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
 41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
 41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
 41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
 41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and
 41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,
 41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,
 41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
 41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
 41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
 41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
 41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
 41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
 41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
 41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
 41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
 41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
 41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
 41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
 41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
 41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
 41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
 41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph
 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
 41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
 41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
 42:3 And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
 42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
 42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
 42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
 42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
 42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
 42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
 42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
 42:11 We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
 42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
 42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one
 42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
 42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
 42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.
 42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for
 42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
 42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
 42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
 42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
 42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
 42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
 42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it
 42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32
 42:32 We
 42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall
 42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
 42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
 42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
 42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
 43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.
 43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they
 43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
 43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
 43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
 43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
 43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
 43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
 43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of
 43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
 43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s
 43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they
 43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
 43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
 43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them
 43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
 43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
 43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
 43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
 43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
 43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
 43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,
 43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
 43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s
 44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the
 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
 44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
 44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
 44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was
 44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?

Exodus 11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
Exodus 11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
Exodus 11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
Exodus 11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
Exodus 11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
Exodus 12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
Exodus 12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the

Exodus 12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
Exodus 12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
Exodus 12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
Exodus 12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and
Exodus 12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,

Exodus 12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
Exodus 13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2
Exodus 13:2 Sanctify unto me all
Exodus 13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
Exodus 13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.
Exodus 13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
Exodus 13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
Exodus 13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no

Exodus 14:2 Speak unto the
Exodus 14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
Exodus 14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after
Exodus 14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
Exodus 14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
Exodus 14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots
Exodus 14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
Exodus 14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
Exodus 14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
Exodus 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
Exodus 14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
Exodus 14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
Exodus 14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
Exodus 14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,

Exodus 14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
Exodus 14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
Exodus 14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
Exodus 14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
Exodus 14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
Exodus 14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
Exodus 14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
Exodus 14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
Exodus 14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
Exodus 15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
Exodus 15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:
Exodus 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
Exodus 15:4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
Exodus 15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
Exodus 15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
Exodus 15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
Exodus 15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
Exodus 15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
Exodus 15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
Exodus 15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
Exodus 15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
Exodus 15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on
Exodus 15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
Exodus 15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
Exodus 15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
Exodus 15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

Exodus 15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into
Exodus 15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
Exodus 15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
Exodus 15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
Exodus 16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
Exodus 16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
Exodus 16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
Exodus 16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall

Exodus 16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
Exodus 16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
Exodus 16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12
Exodus 16:12 I have heard the
Exodus 16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
Exodus 16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
Exodus 16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
Exodus 16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
Exodus 16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
Exodus 16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
Exodus 16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
Exodus 16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
Exodus 16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
Exodus 16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
Exodus 16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To
Exodus 16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did
Exodus 16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
Exodus 16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
Exodus 16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
Exodus 16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
Exodus 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus 16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
Exodus 16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
Exodus 16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
Exodus 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
Exodus 16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
Exodus 16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus 17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
Exodus 17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
Exodus 17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take
Exodus 17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
Exodus 17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
Exodus 17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
Exodus 17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
Exodus 17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel

Exodus 17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
Exodus 17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
Exodus 17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
Exodus 18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of
Exodus 18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for
Exodus 18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,
Exodus 18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
Exodus 18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
Exodus 18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
Exodus 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
Exodus 18:12 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and
Exodus 18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
Exodus 18:14 And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people,
Exodus 18:17 And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
Exodus 18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
Exodus 18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
Exodus 18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such
Exodus 18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou

Exodus 19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth
Exodus 19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert
Exodus 19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of
Exodus 19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
Exodus 19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
Exodus 19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD
Exodus 19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
Exodus 19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
Exodus 19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
Exodus 19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
Exodus 19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
Exodus 19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there
Exodus 19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
Exodus 19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
Exodus 19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
Exodus 19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
Exodus 19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
Exodus 19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify
Exodus 19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount
Exodus 19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt
Exodus 19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
Exodus 20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2
Exodus 20:2 I am the LORD thy
Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Exodus 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
Exodus 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
Exodus 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the
Exodus 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10
Exodus 20:10 But the

Exodus 20:15 Thou shalt not steal.
Exodus 20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Exodus 20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet
Exodus 20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and
Exodus 20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:
Exodus 20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
Exodus 20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
Exodus 20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
Exodus 20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make
Exodus 20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
Exodus 20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build
Exodus 20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
Exodus 21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
Exodus 21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in
Exodus 21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
Exodus 21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons
Exodus 21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
Exodus 21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not
Exodus 21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,
Exodus 21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
Exodus 21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty
Exodus 21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
Exodus 21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
Exodus 21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;
Exodus 21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him
Exodus 21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
Exodus 21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
Exodus 21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
Exodus 21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,
Exodus 21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he

Exodus 21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus 21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Exodus 21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his

Exodus 40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2
Exodus 40:2 On the first day of
Exodus 40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
Exodus 40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
Exodus 40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the

Exodus 40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
Exodus 40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
Exodus 40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and

Leviticus 4:2 Speak unto the children
Leviticus 4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of
Leviticus 4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood,
Leviticus 4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
Leviticus 4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the
Leviticus 4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,

Leviticus 6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
Leviticus 6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
Leviticus 6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It

Leviticus 6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
Leviticus 6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and
Leviticus 6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
Leviticus 6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the

Leviticus 7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
Leviticus 7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
Leviticus 7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
Leviticus 7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
Leviticus 7:8 And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the
Leviticus 7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that

Leviticus 7:23 Speak unto the
Leviticus 7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
Leviticus 7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
Leviticus 7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
Leviticus 7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that

Leviticus 7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
Leviticus 7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
Leviticus 7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
Leviticus 7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
Leviticus 7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and

Leviticus 8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
Leviticus 8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
Leviticus 8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
Leviticus 8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the

Leviticus 8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
Leviticus 8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
Leviticus 8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and
Leviticus 8:13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and
Leviticus 8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
Leviticus 8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
Leviticus 8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
Leviticus 8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
Leviticus 8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his

Leviticus 8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was
Leviticus 8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
Leviticus 8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
Leviticus 8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
Leviticus 8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
Leviticus 8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
Leviticus 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by
Leviticus 9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and
Leviticus 9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye
Leviticus 9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle
Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye
Leviticus 9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
Leviticus 9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
Leviticus 9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped
Leviticus 9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus 9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto
Leviticus 9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
Leviticus 9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
Leviticus 9:15 And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which
Leviticus 9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
Leviticus 9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
Leviticus 9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
Leviticus 9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon

Leviticus 9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
Leviticus 9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon
Leviticus 10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
Leviticus 10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
Leviticus 10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
Leviticus 10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
Leviticus 10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
Leviticus 10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
Leviticus 10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
Leviticus 10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9
Leviticus 10:9 Do not drink wine nor

Leviticus 10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
Leviticus 10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
Leviticus 10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
Leviticus 10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
Leviticus 11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus 11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts
Leviticus 11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
Leviticus 11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or
Leviticus 11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
Leviticus 11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
Leviticus 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
Leviticus 11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
Leviticus 11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
Leviticus 11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
Leviticus 11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be
Leviticus 11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
Leviticus 11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
Leviticus 11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
Leviticus 11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
Leviticus 11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
Leviticus 11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
Leviticus 11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
Leviticus 11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
Leviticus 11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,
Leviticus 11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
Leviticus 11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth

Leviticus 11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
Leviticus 11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
Leviticus 11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
Leviticus 11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
Leviticus 11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their

Leviticus 18:7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
Leviticus 18:8 The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is
Leviticus 18:9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
Leviticus 18:10 The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s
Leviticus 18:11 The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy
Leviticus 18:12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she

Leviticus 19:6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
Leviticus 19:7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
Leviticus 19:8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
Leviticus 19:9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly
Leviticus 19:10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
Leviticus 19:11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to

Leviticus 19:24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
Leviticus 19:25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it
Leviticus 19:26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use
Leviticus 19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou
Leviticus 19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
Leviticus 19:29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest

Leviticus 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
Leviticus 19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of
Leviticus 19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
Leviticus 19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
Leviticus 19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
Leviticus 19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall
Leviticus 19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
Leviticus 20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2
Leviticus 20:2 Again, thou shalt say
Leviticus 20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
Leviticus 20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
Leviticus 20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
Leviticus 20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
Leviticus 20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD
Leviticus 20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which
Leviticus 20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
Leviticus 20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife,
Leviticus 20:11 And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his

Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
Leviticus 20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
Leviticus 20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:
Leviticus 20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
Leviticus 20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or
Leviticus 20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
Leviticus 20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister,
Leviticus 20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered
Leviticus 20:21 And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean
Leviticus 20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
Leviticus 20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast
Leviticus 20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
Leviticus 20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
Leviticus 20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
Leviticus 20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a

Leviticus 21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
Leviticus 21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither
Leviticus 21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of
Leviticus 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing

Leviticus 22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
Leviticus 22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
Leviticus 22:12 If the priest’s daughter also be married unto a stranger, she

Leviticus 25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
Leviticus 25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
Leviticus 25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
Leviticus 25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
Leviticus 25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
Leviticus 25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
Leviticus 25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
Leviticus 25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for

Leviticus 25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
Leviticus 25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
Leviticus 25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
Leviticus 25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
Leviticus 25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
Leviticus 25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
Leviticus 25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
Leviticus 25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
Leviticus 25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
Leviticus 25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
Leviticus 25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
Leviticus 25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land
Leviticus 25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
Leviticus 25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
Leviticus 25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among

Leviticus 25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
Leviticus 25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
Leviticus 25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall

Leviticus 25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
Leviticus 25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
Leviticus 25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
Leviticus 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
Leviticus 26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
Leviticus 26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus 26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
Leviticus 26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
Leviticus 26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
Leviticus 26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
Leviticus 26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
Leviticus 26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
Leviticus 26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
Leviticus 26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
Leviticus 26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be
Leviticus 26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
Leviticus 26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
Leviticus 26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
Leviticus 26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
Leviticus 26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
Leviticus 26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
Leviticus 26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
Leviticus 26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
Leviticus 26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
Leviticus 26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
Leviticus 26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
Leviticus 26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
Leviticus 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
Leviticus 26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
Leviticus 26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
Leviticus 26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
Leviticus 26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
Leviticus 26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
Leviticus 26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
Leviticus 26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
Leviticus 26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
Leviticus 26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
Leviticus 26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
Leviticus 26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
Leviticus 26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
Leviticus 26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
Leviticus 26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
Leviticus 27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2
Leviticus 27:2 Speak unto the

Leviticus 27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present

Leviticus 27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
Leviticus 27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
Leviticus 27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
Leviticus 27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
Leviticus 27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
Leviticus 27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
Leviticus 27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
Leviticus 27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
Leviticus 27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
Leviticus 27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
Leviticus 27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
Leviticus 27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath

Numbers 10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
Numbers 10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
Numbers 10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
Numbers 10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in
Numbers 10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
Numbers 10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
Numbers 10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
Numbers 10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
Numbers 10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
Numbers 10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
Numbers 10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
Numbers 10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
Numbers 10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
Numbers 10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the

Numbers 10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
Numbers 10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
Numbers 10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
Numbers 10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
Numbers 10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
Numbers 10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
Numbers 10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’
Numbers 10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
Numbers 10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
Numbers 10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
Numbers 11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
Numbers 11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
Numbers 11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
Numbers 11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
Numbers 11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
Numbers 11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
Numbers 11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
Numbers 11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
Numbers 11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
Numbers 11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
Numbers 11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
Numbers 11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
Numbers 11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
Numbers 11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
Numbers 11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
Numbers 11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
Numbers 11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
Numbers 11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
Numbers 11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
Numbers 11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Numbers 11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
Numbers 11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
Numbers 11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
Numbers 11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
Numbers 11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
Numbers 11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
Numbers 11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
Numbers 12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
Numbers 12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he
Numbers 12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
Numbers 12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in
Numbers 12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,
Numbers 12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.
Numbers 12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
Numbers 12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
Numbers 12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
Numbers 12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
Numbers 12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
Numbers 12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
Numbers 12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
Numbers 12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
Numbers 12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
Numbers 13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2
Numbers 13:2 Send thou men, that
Numbers 13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
Numbers 13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the

Numbers 13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
Numbers 13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
Numbers 13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
Numbers 13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
Numbers 13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
Numbers 13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
Numbers 13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
Numbers 13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
Numbers 13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
Numbers 13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
Numbers 13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,
Numbers 13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
Numbers 13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
Numbers 13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
Numbers 13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
Numbers 14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
Numbers 14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Numbers 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
Numbers 14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
Numbers 14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
Numbers 14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of
Numbers 14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
Numbers 14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke
Numbers 14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,
Numbers 14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they
Numbers 14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
Numbers 14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,
Numbers 14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
Numbers 14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21
Numbers 14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
Numbers 14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
Numbers 14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27
Numbers 14:27 How
Numbers 14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
Numbers 14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
Numbers 14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
Numbers 14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
Numbers 14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
Numbers 14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
Numbers 14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
Numbers 14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,
Numbers 14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
Numbers 14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
Numbers 14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
Numbers 14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
Numbers 14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten
Numbers 14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and
Numbers 14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
Numbers 14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
Numbers 15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2
Numbers 15:2 Speak unto the
Numbers 15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
Numbers 15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
Numbers 15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
Numbers 15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
Numbers 15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
Numbers 15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
Numbers 15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
Numbers 15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
Numbers 15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
Numbers 15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
Numbers 15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
Numbers 15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
Numbers 15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18
Numbers 15:18 Speak unto the
Numbers 15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
Numbers 15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
Numbers 15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
Numbers 15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
Numbers 15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
Numbers 15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
Numbers 15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
Numbers 15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born
Numbers 15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
Numbers 15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
Numbers 15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
Numbers 15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
Numbers 15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
Numbers 15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
Numbers 15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38
Numbers 15:38 Speak unto the
Numbers 15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Numbers 16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
Numbers 16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7
Numbers 16:7 And
Numbers 16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
Numbers 16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
Numbers 16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
Numbers 16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
Numbers 16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
Numbers 16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
Numbers 16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21
Numbers 16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
Numbers 16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
Numbers 16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
Numbers 16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
Numbers 16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
Numbers 16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me
Numbers 16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
Numbers 16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,
Numbers 16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
Numbers 16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
Numbers 16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
Numbers 16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
Numbers 16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37
Numbers 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar
Numbers 16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
Numbers 16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
Numbers 16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
Numbers 16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
Numbers 16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
Numbers 16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45
Numbers 16:45 Get you up from
Numbers 16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
Numbers 16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
Numbers 16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
Numbers 16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
Numbers 16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
Numbers 17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2
Numbers 17:2 Speak unto the
Numbers 17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one
Numbers 17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
Numbers 17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man’s rod, whom I shall
Numbers 17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
Numbers 17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of
Numbers 17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
Numbers 17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all
Numbers 17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the
Numbers 17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
Numbers 17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
Numbers 17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
Numbers 18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
Numbers 18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
Numbers 18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
Numbers 18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
Numbers 18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among
Numbers 18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s
Numbers 18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
Numbers 18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
Numbers 18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
Numbers 18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
Numbers 18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
Numbers 18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
Numbers 18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
Numbers 18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
Numbers 18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
Numbers 18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
Numbers 18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as
Numbers 18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
Numbers 18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in
Numbers 18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
Numbers 18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
Numbers 18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
Numbers 18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
Numbers 18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26
Numbers 18:26 Thus speak unto the
Numbers 18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
Numbers 18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all
Numbers 18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
Numbers 18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
Numbers 18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for
Numbers 18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
Numbers 19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2
Numbers 19:2 This
Numbers 19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring
Numbers 19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
Numbers 19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
Numbers 19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
Numbers 19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
Numbers 19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
Numbers 19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
Numbers 19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
Numbers 19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
Numbers 19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into
Numbers 19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
Numbers 19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
Numbers 19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
Numbers 19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
Numbers 19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
Numbers 19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and
Numbers 20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
Numbers 20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
Numbers 20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
Numbers 20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
Numbers 20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8
Numbers 20:8 Take the rod, and
Numbers 20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
Numbers 20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
Numbers 20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me
Numbers 20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
Numbers 20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
Numbers 20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
Numbers 20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
Numbers 20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
Numbers 20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
Numbers 20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
Numbers 20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
Numbers 20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
Numbers 20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount
Numbers 20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
Numbers 20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
Numbers 21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
Numbers 21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
Numbers 21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
Numbers 21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
Numbers 21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
Numbers 21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
Numbers 21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for
Numbers 21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
Numbers 21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
Numbers 21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
Numbers 21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
Numbers 21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
Numbers 21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
Numbers 21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
Numbers 21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
Numbers 21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
Numbers 21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,
Numbers 21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
Numbers 21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
Numbers 21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
Numbers 21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
Numbers 21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
Numbers 21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
Numbers 21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath
Numbers 21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
Numbers 21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
Numbers 21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
Numbers 21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered
Numbers 21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there
Numbers 22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains
Numbers 22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Numbers 22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
Numbers 22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
Numbers 22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Numbers 22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
Numbers 22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
Numbers 22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
Numbers 22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
Numbers 22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
Numbers 22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
Numbers 22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
Numbers 22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
Numbers 22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
Numbers 22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
Numbers 22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
Numbers 22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
Numbers 22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
Numbers 22:22 And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
Numbers 22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
Numbers 22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
Numbers 22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
Numbers 22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
Numbers 22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
Numbers 22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
Numbers 22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
Numbers 22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
Numbers 22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
Numbers 22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
Numbers 22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
Numbers 22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
Numbers 22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
Numbers 22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
Numbers 22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
Numbers 22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
Numbers 23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
Numbers 23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
Numbers 23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
Numbers 23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven

Joshua 3:17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Joshua 4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over
Joshua 4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
Joshua 4:8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
Joshua 4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
Joshua 4:10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
Joshua 4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,
Joshua 4:12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
Joshua 4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
Joshua 4:15 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16
Joshua 4:16 Command the priests
Joshua 4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
Joshua 4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
Joshua 4:19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
Joshua 4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
Joshua 4:21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
Joshua 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
Joshua 5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
Joshua 5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
Joshua 5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
Joshua 5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people
Joshua 5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
Joshua 5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
Joshua 5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
Joshua 5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
Joshua 5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
Joshua 5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
Joshua 5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
Joshua 5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
Joshua 5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
Joshua 6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
Joshua 6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
Joshua 6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
Joshua 6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
Joshua 6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
Joshua 6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
Joshua 6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and
Joshua 6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that
Joshua 6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
Joshua 6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
Joshua 6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:
Joshua 6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the
Joshua 6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before
Joshua 6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
Joshua 6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
Joshua 6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
Joshua 6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
Joshua 6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest
Joshua 6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
Joshua 6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
Joshua 6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
Joshua 6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
Joshua 6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,
Joshua 6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only
Joshua 6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
Joshua 6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
Joshua 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout
Joshua 7:1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
Joshua 7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,
Joshua 7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
Joshua 7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:
Joshua 7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
Joshua 7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
Joshua 7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
Joshua 7:12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
Joshua 7:13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
Joshua 7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
Joshua 7:15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
Joshua 7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
Joshua 7:18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
Joshua 7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to
Joshua 7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against
Joshua 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
Joshua 7:23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
Joshua 7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
Joshua 7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
Joshua 7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So
Joshua 8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
Joshua 8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:
Joshua 8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
Joshua 8:7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:
Joshua 8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set
Joshua 8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,
Joshua 8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
Joshua 8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
Joshua 8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
Joshua 8:13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on
Joshua 8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
Joshua 8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
Joshua 8:16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
Joshua 8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
Joshua 8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in
Joshua 8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as
Joshua 8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,
Joshua 8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
Joshua 8:22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
Joshua 8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua 8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all
Joshua 8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
Joshua 8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
Joshua 8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
Joshua 8:28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
Joshua 8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
Joshua 8:30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
Joshua 8:32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
Joshua 8:33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
Joshua 8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
Joshua 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
Joshua 9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
Joshua 9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and
Joshua 9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
Joshua 9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
Joshua 9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
Joshua 9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
Joshua 9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
Joshua 9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
Joshua 9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
Joshua 9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to
Joshua 9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
Joshua 9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
Joshua 9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of
Joshua 9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
Joshua 9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
Joshua 9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
Joshua 9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
Joshua 9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
Joshua 9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
Joshua 9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
Joshua 9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
Joshua 10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
Joshua 10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of
Joshua 10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
Joshua 10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
Joshua 10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
Joshua 10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
Joshua 10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
Joshua 10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
Joshua 10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
Joshua 10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
Joshua 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
Joshua 10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
Joshua 10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Joshua 10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
Joshua 10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in
Joshua 10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
Joshua 10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
Joshua 10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
Joshua 10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
Joshua 10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out
Joshua 10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
Joshua 10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
Joshua 10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
Joshua 10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
Joshua 10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of
Joshua 10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
Joshua 10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
Joshua 10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
Joshua 10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
Joshua 10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
Joshua 10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
Joshua 10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
Joshua 10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
Joshua 10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
Joshua 10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Joshua 11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
Joshua 11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
Joshua 11:5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
Joshua 11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for
Joshua 11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
Joshua 11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
Joshua 11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their
Joshua 11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
Joshua 11:11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
Joshua 11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
Joshua 11:13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
Joshua 11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children
Joshua 11:15 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
Joshua 11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
Joshua 11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua 11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
Joshua 11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should
Joshua 11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
Joshua 11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
Joshua 11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
Joshua 12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
Joshua 12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
Joshua 12:6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel
Joshua 12:7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
Joshua 12:10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11
Joshua 12:11 The
Joshua 13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto
Joshua 13:2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
Joshua 13:6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
Joshua 13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
Joshua 13:13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,
Joshua 13:14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
Joshua 13:15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
Joshua 13:16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
Joshua 13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
Joshua 13:23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
Joshua 13:24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
Joshua 13:25 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
Joshua 13:28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
Joshua 13:29 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and
Joshua 13:30 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
Joshua 13:32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
Joshua 13:33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
Joshua 14:1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
Joshua 14:2 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand
Joshua 14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
Joshua 14:4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
Joshua 14:5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and
Joshua 14:6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb
Joshua 14:7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me
Joshua 14:8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of
Joshua 14:9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
Joshua 14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
Joshua 14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
Joshua 14:12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
Joshua 14:13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Joshua 14:14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
Joshua 14:15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
Joshua 15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
Joshua 15:2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
Joshua 15:5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
Joshua 15:9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
Joshua 15:10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
Joshua 15:11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
Joshua 15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.
Joshua 15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
Joshua 15:14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
Joshua 15:15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name
Joshua 15:16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to
Joshua 15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and
Joshua 15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to
Joshua 15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
Joshua 15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah

Joshua 15:29 Baalah, and
Joshua 15:34 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 15:35
Joshua 15:35 Jarmuth, and
Joshua 15:57 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: 15:58
Joshua 15:63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
Joshua 16:1 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
Joshua 16:3 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
Joshua 16:4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
Joshua 16:5 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
Joshua 16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
Joshua 16:9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
Joshua 16:10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
Joshua 17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
Joshua 17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
Joshua 17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
Joshua 17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
Joshua 17:5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
Joshua 17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
Joshua 17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border
Joshua 17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
Joshua 17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
Joshua 17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
Joshua 17:14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
Joshua 17:16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:
Joshua 17:17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
Joshua 18:1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
Joshua 18:2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
Joshua 18:3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
Joshua 18:5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in
Joshua 18:6 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring
Joshua 18:7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
Joshua 18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
Joshua 18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
Joshua 18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
Joshua 18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
Joshua 18:12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
Joshua 18:13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
Joshua 18:14 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the

Joshua 19:49 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
Joshua 19:51 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
Joshua 20:1 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 20:2
Joshua 20:2 Speak to the

Judges 9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
Judges 9:27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,
Judges 9:28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is

Judges 9:31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
Judges 9:32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,
Judges 9:34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
Judges 9:35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of
Judges 9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
Judges 9:37 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the

Judges 9:42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into
Judges 9:43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
Judges 9:44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,
Judges 9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
Judges 9:46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they

Judges 9:48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
Judges 9:49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
Judges 9:50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
Judges 9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
Judges 9:52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
Judges 9:53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s
Judges 9:54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and
Judges 9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they

1 Kings 2:24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
1 Kings 2:25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if
1 Kings 2:26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
1 Kings 2:27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
1 Kings 2:31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm
1 Kings 2:32 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
1 Kings 2:33 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
1 Kings 2:34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
1 Kings 2:35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according
1 Kings 2:36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine
1 Kings 3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the
1 Kings 3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
1 Kings 3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.
1 Kings 3:6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
1 Kings 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the
1 Kings 3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
1 Kings 3:9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if
1 Kings 3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
1 Kings 3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
1 Kings 3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
1 Kings 3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
1 Kings 3:14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
1 Kings 3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
1 Kings 3:16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
1 Kings 3:17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?
1 Kings 3:18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
1 Kings 3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
1 Kings 3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
1 Kings 3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
1 Kings 4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
1 Kings 4:2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and
1 Kings 4:3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
1 Kings 4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
1 Kings 4:5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
1 Kings 4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
1 Kings 4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into
1 Kings 4:8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
1 Kings 4:9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye
1 Kings 4:10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
1 Kings 4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
1 Kings 4:12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
1 Kings 4:13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
1 Kings 4:14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
1 Kings 4:15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
1 Kings 4:16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and
1 Kings 4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that
1 Kings 4:19 And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to
1 Kings 4:20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
1 Kings 4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
1 Kings 4:22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of
1 Kings 5:1 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
1 Kings 5:2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
1 Kings 5:3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon
1 Kings 5:4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
1 Kings 5:5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
1 Kings 5:6 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
1 Kings 5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
1 Kings 5:8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
1 Kings 5:9 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of
1 Kings 5:10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
1 Kings 5:11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
1 Kings 5:12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the
1 Kings 6:1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
1 Kings 6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
1 Kings 6:3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send
1 Kings 6:4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
1 Kings 6:5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
1 Kings 6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
1 Kings 6:9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
1 Kings 6:10 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
1 Kings 6:12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
1 Kings 6:13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
1 Kings 6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
1 Kings 6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
1 Kings 6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
1 Kings 6:17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
1 Kings 6:19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into
1 Kings 6:20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
1 Kings 7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
1 Kings 7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
1 Kings 7:3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
1 Kings 7:4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
1 Kings 7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
1 Kings 7:6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
1 Kings 7:7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
1 Kings 7:8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
1 Kings 7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
1 Kings 7:10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
1 Kings 7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
1 Kings 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
1 Kings 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
1 Kings 7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
1 Kings 7:15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Kings 7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
1 Kings 7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
1 Kings 8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
1 Kings 8:2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
1 Kings 8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
1 Kings 8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
1 Kings 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
1 Kings 8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
1 Kings 8:8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that
1 Kings 8:9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
1 Kings 8:10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
1 Kings 8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
1 Kings 8:12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
1 Kings 8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
1 Kings 8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
1 Kings 8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
1 Kings 8:16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
1 Kings 8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
1 Kings 8:18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
1 Kings 8:19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
1 Kings 8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
1 Kings 8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make
1 Kings 9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
1 Kings 9:2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
1 Kings 9:3 And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to
1 Kings 9:4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land
1 Kings 9:5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
1 Kings 9:6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of
1 Kings 9:7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
1 Kings 9:9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
1 Kings 9:11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
1 Kings 9:12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
1 Kings 9:14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
1 Kings 9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
1 Kings 9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man
1 Kings 9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
1 Kings 9:19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before
1 Kings 9:20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
1 Kings 9:23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
1 Kings 9:24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
1 Kings 9:25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
1 Kings 9:26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
1 Kings 9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
1 Kings 10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
1 Kings 10:4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
1 Kings 10:5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
1 Kings 10:7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do
1 Kings 10:8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will
1 Kings 10:9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
1 Kings 10:10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
1 Kings 10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
1 Kings 10:14 And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went
1 Kings 10:15 And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
1 Kings 10:16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses
1 Kings 10:17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
1 Kings 10:18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
1 Kings 10:20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
1 Kings 10:21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
1 Kings 10:22 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
1 Kings 10:23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
1 Kings 10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
1 Kings 10:25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
1 Kings 10:26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
1 Kings 10:27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
1 Kings 11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
1 Kings 11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I
1 Kings 11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’
1 Kings 11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
1 Kings 11:5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
1 Kings 11:6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
1 Kings 11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
1 Kings 11:8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were
1 Kings 11:9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
1 Kings 11:10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
1 Kings 11:11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
1 Kings 11:12 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
1 Kings 11:13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
1 Kings 11:14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
1 Kings 11:15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
1 Kings 12:1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
1 Kings 12:2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
1 Kings 12:3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before
1 Kings 12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
1 Kings 12:5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his
1 Kings 12:6 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
1 Kings 12:7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the
1 Kings 12:8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
1 Kings 12:9 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
1 Kings 12:10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because
1 Kings 12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
1 Kings 12:12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
1 Kings 12:13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
1 Kings 12:14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and
1 Kings 12:16 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
1 Kings 12:17 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
1 Kings 12:18 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
1 Kings 12:19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto
1 Kings 12:20 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
1 Kings 12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s
1 Kings 12:23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
1 Kings 12:25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye
1 Kings 13:1 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
1 Kings 13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
1 Kings 13:4 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
1 Kings 13:5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
1 Kings 13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
1 Kings 13:7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
1 Kings 13:8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
1 Kings 13:9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
1 Kings 13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
1 Kings 13:11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
1 Kings 13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
1 Kings 13:14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him
1 Kings 13:15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
1 Kings 13:16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
1 Kings 13:17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
1 Kings 13:19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:
1 Kings 13:20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
1 Kings 13:21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and
1 Kings 13:22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
1 Kings 13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
1 Kings 14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
1 Kings 14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
1 Kings 14:4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
1 Kings 14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
1 Kings 14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
1 Kings 14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
1 Kings 14:8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and
1 Kings 14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
1 Kings 14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
1 Kings 14:11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
1 Kings 14:12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
1 Kings 14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
1 Kings 14:14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
1 Kings 14:15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all
1 Kings 14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
1 Kings 14:17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
1 Kings 14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
1 Kings 14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
1 Kings 14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
1 Kings 14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
1 Kings 14:22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
1 Kings 14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
1 Kings 14:24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
1 Kings 14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
1 Kings 14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
1 Kings 14:27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
1 Kings 14:28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
1 Kings 14:29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
1 Kings 14:30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
1 Kings 14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
1 Kings 14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
1 Kings 14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
1 Kings 14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
1 Kings 14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
1 Kings 14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
1 Kings 14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:
1 Kings 14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
1 Kings 14:40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
1 Kings 14:41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect
1 Kings 14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
1 Kings 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
1 Kings 14:44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
1 Kings 14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
1 Kings 14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
1 Kings 14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
1 Kings 14:48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
1 Kings 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
1 Kings 14:51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
1 Kings 14:52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
1 Kings 15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
1 Kings 15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
1 Kings 15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
1 Kings 15:4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
1 Kings 15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1 Kings 15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
1 Kings 15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
1 Kings 15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
1 Kings 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
1 Kings 15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11
1 Kings 15:11 It
1 Kings 15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
1 Kings 15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
1 Kings 15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
1 Kings 15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
1 Kings 15:17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast
1 Kings 15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
1 Kings 15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
1 Kings 15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
1 Kings 15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
1 Kings 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
1 Kings 15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
1 Kings 15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
1 Kings 15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
1 Kings 15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
1 Kings 15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
1 Kings 15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he
1 Kings 15:30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
1 Kings 15:31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
1 Kings 15:32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
1 Kings 15:33 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
1 Kings 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
1 Kings 15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
1 Kings 16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
1 Kings 16:2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
1 Kings 16:3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou
1 Kings 16:4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
1 Kings 16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
1 Kings 16:7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
1 Kings 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And
1 Kings 16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
1 Kings 16:10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
1 Kings 16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
1 Kings 16:12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of
1 Kings 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
1 Kings 16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
1 Kings 16:15 And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
1 Kings 16:16 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
1 Kings 16:17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
1 Kings 16:18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen
1 Kings 16:19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
1 Kings 16:20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
1 Kings 16:21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
1 Kings 16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
1 Kings 16:23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
1 Kings 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
1 Kings 17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
1 Kings 17:3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
1 Kings 17:4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
1 Kings 17:5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
1 Kings 17:6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
1 Kings 17:7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his
1 Kings 17:8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto
1 Kings 17:9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be
1 Kings 17:10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
1 Kings 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
1 Kings 17:12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
1 Kings 17:13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
1 Kings 17:14 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Kings 17:15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep
1 Kings 17:16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
1 Kings 17:17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
1 Kings 17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
1 Kings 17:20 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
1 Kings 17:21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
1 Kings 17:22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
1 Kings 17:23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
1 Kings 17:24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
1 Kings 17:25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
1 Kings 17:26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall
1 Kings 17:28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
1 Kings 17:29 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1 Kings 17:30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
1 Kings 17:31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
1 Kings 17:32 And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him;
1 Kings 17:33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
1 Kings 17:34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep,
1 Kings 17:35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
1 Kings 17:36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
1 Kings 17:37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
1 Kings 17:38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
1 Kings 17:39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
1 Kings 17:40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
1 Kings 17:41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
1 Kings 17:42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
1 Kings 17:43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest
1 Kings 17:44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
1 Kings 17:45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
1 Kings 17:46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
1 Kings 17:47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
1 Kings 17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
1 Kings 17:49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
1 Kings 17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
1 Kings 17:51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
1 Kings 17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
1 Kings 17:53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
1 Kings 17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
1 Kings 17:55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
1 Kings 17:56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1 Kings 17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
1 Kings 17:58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
1 Kings 18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
1 Kings 18:2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to
1 Kings 18:3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as
1 Kings 18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
1 Kings 18:5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
1 Kings 18:6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
1 Kings 18:7 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
1 Kings 18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
1 Kings 18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Kings 18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
1 Kings 18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
1 Kings 18:12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and
1 Kings 18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
1 Kings 18:14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
1 Kings 18:15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he
1 Kings 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
1 Kings 18:17 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will
1 Kings 18:18 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
1 Kings 18:19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter
1 Kings 18:20 And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and
1 Kings 18:21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
1 Kings 18:22 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
1 Kings 18:23 And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
1 Kings 18:25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not
1 Kings 18:26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
1 Kings 18:27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
1 Kings 18:28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
1 Kings 18:29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
1 Kings 18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
1 Kings 19:1 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that
1 Kings 19:2 But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
1 Kings 19:4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said
1 Kings 19:7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
1 Kings 19:8 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
1 Kings 19:9 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
1 Kings 19:10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
1 Kings 19:11 Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and
1 Kings 19:12 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
1 Kings 19:13 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
1 Kings 19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
1 Kings 19:15 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
1 Kings 19:16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image
1 Kings 19:17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
1 Kings 19:19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
1 Kings 19:20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
1 Kings 19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
1 Kings 19:22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
1 Kings 19:23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
1 Kings 19:24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
1 Kings 20:3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
1 Kings 20:4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
1 Kings 20:5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,
1 Kings 20:6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
1 Kings 20:7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if
1 Kings 20:8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
1 Kings 20:12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
1 Kings 20:14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
1 Kings 20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let
1 Kings 20:17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:
1 Kings 20:18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
1 Kings 20:19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
1 Kings 20:20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
1 Kings 20:21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
1 Kings 20:22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
1 Kings 20:23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
1 Kings 20:24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
1 Kings 20:25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
1 Kings 20:26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
1 Kings 20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
1 Kings 20:30 Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
1 Kings 20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
1 Kings 20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
1 Kings 20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
1 Kings 20:36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
1 Kings 20:37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
1 Kings 20:39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the
1 Kings 20:40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
1 Kings 20:41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
1 Kings 20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
1 Kings 21:1 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
1 Kings 21:3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
1 Kings 21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
1 Kings 21:5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
1 Kings 21:6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
1 Kings 21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
1 Kings 21:8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine
1 Kings 21:9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
1 Kings 21:10 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
1 Kings 21:11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the
1 Kings 21:12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid
1 Kings 21:13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
1 Kings 21:14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
1 Kings 22:2 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
1 Kings 22:3 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
1 Kings 22:4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with
1 Kings 22:5 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
1 Kings 22:6 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were
1 Kings 22:10 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and
1 Kings 22:11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
1 Kings 22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
1 Kings 22:13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
1 Kings 22:16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
1 Kings 22:17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
1 Kings 22:18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
1 Kings 22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
1 Kings 22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
1 Kings 22:21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’s
1 Kings 22:22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
1 Kings 22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
1 Kings 23:1 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
1 Kings 23:2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
1 Kings 23:3 And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
1 Kings 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
1 Kings 23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
1 Kings 23:7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
1 Kings 23:8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
1 Kings 23:9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;
1 Kings 23:10 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
1 Kings 23:11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
1 Kings 23:12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
1 Kings 23:13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
1 Kings 23:14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
1 Kings 23:15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David
1 Kings 23:16 And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood,
1 Kings 23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
1 Kings 23:18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in
1 Kings 23:19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
1 Kings 23:21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion
1 Kings 23:22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
1 Kings 23:23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
1 Kings 23:24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his
1 Kings 23:25 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
1 Kings 23:26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
1 Kings 23:27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
1 Kings 23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
1 Kings 23:29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
1 Kings 24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
1 Kings 24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
1 Kings 24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
1 Kings 24:4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
1 Kings 24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him,
1 Kings 24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
1 Kings 24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
1 Kings 24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
1 Kings 24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,
1 Kings 24:11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
1 Kings 24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
1 Kings 24:13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from
1 Kings 24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
1 Kings 24:15 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
1 Kings 24:16 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
1 Kings 24:17 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
1 Kings 24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
1 Kings 24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
1 Kings 24:20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
1 Kings 24:21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
1 Kings 24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his
1 Kings 25:1 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
1 Kings 25:2 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
1 Kings 25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
1 Kings 25:4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
1 Kings 25:5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
1 Kings 25:6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be
1 Kings 25:7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds
1 Kings 25:8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
1 Kings 25:9 And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to
1 Kings 25:10 And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and
1 Kings 25:11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
1 Kings 25:13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
1 Kings 25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,
1 Kings 25:15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
1 Kings 25:17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
1 Kings 25:18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
1 Kings 25:19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
1 Kings 25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
1 Kings 25:21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
1 Kings 25:22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of
1 Kings 25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
1 Kings 25:24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
1 Kings 25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
1 Kings 25:26 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
1 Kings 25:27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
1 Kings 25:28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
1 Kings 25:29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
1 Kings 25:30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
1 Kings 25:32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
1 Kings 25:34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
1 Kings 25:35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
1 Kings 25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
1 Kings 25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
1 Kings 25:38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
1 Kings 25:39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
1 Kings 25:40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
1 Kings 25:41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
1 Kings 25:42 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
1 Kings 25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
1 Kings 25:44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti
1 Kings 26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
1 Kings 26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
1 Kings 26:4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come
1 Kings 26:5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
1 Kings 26:6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
1 Kings 26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
1 Kings 26:8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
1 Kings 26:9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
1 Kings 26:11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
1 Kings 26:12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s
1 Kings 26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of
1 Kings 26:16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
1 Kings 26:17 And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
1 Kings 26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
1 Kings 26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
1 Kings 26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will
1 Kings 26:22 And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let
1 Kings 26:23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
1 Kings 26:24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
1 Kings 26:25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
1 Kings 27:1 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
1 Kings 27:2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
1 Kings 27:3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
1 Kings 27:4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought
1 Kings 27:5 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
1 Kings 27:7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
1 Kings 27:8 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
1 Kings 27:9 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,
1 Kings 27:10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
1 Kings 27:11 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
1 Kings 27:12 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
1 Kings 28:1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
1 Kings 28:2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
1 Kings 28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried
1 Kings 28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
1 Kings 28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and
1 Kings 28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
1 Kings 28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
1 Kings 28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
1 Kings 28:9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
1 Kings 28:11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
1 Kings 28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and
1 Kings 28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
1 Kings 28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
1 Kings 28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
1 Kings 28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
1 Kings 28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
1 Kings 28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
1 Kings 28:21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
1 Kings 28:22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
1 Kings 28:23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
1 Kings 28:24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
1 Kings 29:1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
1 Kings 29:2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
1 Kings 29:3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews
1 Kings 29:7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
1 Kings 29:8 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast
1 Kings 29:9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good
1 Kings 29:10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s
1 Kings 29:11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
1 Kings 30:1 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
1 Kings 30:3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
1 Kings 30:4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
1 Kings 30:5 And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
1 Kings 30:6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
1 Kings 30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray
1 Kings 30:8 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
1 Kings 30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
1 Kings 30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
1 Kings 30:11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
1 Kings 30:13 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
1 Kings 30:14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
1 Kings 30:15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
1 Kings 30:16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
1 Kings 30:17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
1 Kings 30:18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
1 Kings 30:19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
1 Kings 30:20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
1 Kings 30:21 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that
1 Kings 30:22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
1 Kings 30:23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
1 Kings 30:24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
1 Kings 30:25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
1 Kings 30:26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
1 Kings 30:30 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
1 Kings 31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel
1 Kings 31:2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
1 Kings 31:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;
1 Kings 31:4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
1 Kings 31:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
1 Kings 31:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all
1 Kings 31:7 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
1 Kings 31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
1 Kings 31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent
1 Kings 31:10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
1 Kings 31:11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
1 Kings 31:13 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
2 Kings 1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
2 Kings 1:3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
2 Kings 1:4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
2 Kings 1:5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
2 Kings 1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And
2 Kings 1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
2 Kings 1:9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
2 Kings 1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
2 Kings 1:11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
2 Kings 1:13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
2 Kings 1:14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
2 Kings 1:16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
2 Kings 1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
2 Kings 1:19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
2 Kings 1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
2 Kings 1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow
2 Kings 1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
2 Kings 1:24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
2 Kings 1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
2 Kings 1:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast
2 Kings 1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! 2:1
2 Kings 2:2 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
2 Kings 2:3 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with
2 Kings 2:4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over
2 Kings 2:5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said
2 Kings 2:6 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
2 Kings 2:7 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:
2 Kings 2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth
2 Kings 2:10 Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign
2 Kings 2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
2 Kings 2:12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
2 Kings 2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
2 Kings 2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
2 Kings 2:15 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
2 Kings 2:16 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
2 Kings 2:17 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
2 Kings 2:18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
2 Kings 2:19 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
2 Kings 2:20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
2 Kings 2:21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
2 Kings 2:22 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
2 Kings 2:24 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down
2 Kings 2:25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
2 Kings 2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for
2 Kings 2:28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
2 Kings 2:29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
2 Kings 2:30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered
2 Kings 2:31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s
2 Kings 2:32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
2 Kings 3:1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
2 Kings 3:2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
2 Kings 3:6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul
2 Kings 3:7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
2 Kings 3:11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
2 Kings 3:12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose
2 Kings 3:13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing
2 Kings 3:14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying,
2 Kings 3:15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
2 Kings 3:16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
2 Kings 3:17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
2 Kings 3:19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also
2 Kings 3:20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
2 Kings 3:21 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather
2 Kings 3:22 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
2 Kings 3:23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
2 Kings 3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
2 Kings 3:26 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
2 Kings 3:27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
2 Kings 3:28 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
2 Kings 3:30 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
2 Kings 3:31 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
2 Kings 3:32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
2 Kings 3:33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
2 Kings 3:35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it
2 Kings 3:36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
2 Kings 3:37 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
2 Kings 3:38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
2 Kings 4:1 And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
2 Kings 4:2 And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name
2 Kings 4:3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
2 Kings 4:5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
2 Kings 4:6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
2 Kings 4:7 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
2 Kings 4:8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and
2 Kings 4:9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
2 Kings 5:1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
2 Kings 5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
2 Kings 5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
2 Kings 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Kings 5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
2 Kings 5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
2 Kings 5:7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the
2 Kings 5:8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
2 Kings 5:9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
2 Kings 5:10 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was
2 Kings 5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
2 Kings 5:12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
2 Kings 5:13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
2 Kings 5:14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
2 Kings 5:17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
2 Kings 5:18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
2 Kings 5:19 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
2 Kings 5:20 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
2 Kings 5:21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
2 Kings 5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
2 Kings 5:23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go
2 Kings 5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
2 Kings 5:25 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
2 Kings 6:1 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
2 Kings 6:2 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him
2 Kings 6:3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of
2 Kings 6:4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
2 Kings 6:5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on
2 Kings 6:6 And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
2 Kings 6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
2 Kings 6:8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
2 Kings 6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the
2 Kings 6:11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
2 Kings 6:12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
2 Kings 6:13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had
2 Kings 6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
2 Kings 6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
2 Kings 6:16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
2 Kings 6:17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,
2 Kings 6:18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
2 Kings 6:19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
2 Kings 6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
2 Kings 6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine
2 Kings 6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day
2 Kings 7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD
2 Kings 7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
2 Kings 7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
2 Kings 7:7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
2 Kings 7:10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
2 Kings 7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
2 Kings 7:13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
2 Kings 7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
2 Kings 7:16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
2 Kings 7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
2 Kings 7:18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
2 Kings 7:21 For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
2 Kings 7:22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
2 Kings 7:23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
2 Kings 7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
2 Kings 7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
2 Kings 7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
2 Kings 7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
2 Kings 8:1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,
2 Kings 8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
2 Kings 8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
2 Kings 8:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
2 Kings 8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
2 Kings 8:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
2 Kings 8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
2 Kings 8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
2 Kings 8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
2 Kings 8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver
2 Kings 8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
2 Kings 8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
2 Kings 8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
2 Kings 8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
2 Kings 9:1 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
2 Kings 9:3 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that
2 Kings 9:4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the
2 Kings 9:5 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,
2 Kings 9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
2 Kings 9:8 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
2 Kings 9:10 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
2 Kings 9:11 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the
2 Kings 9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all
2 Kings 9:13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at
2 Kings 10:1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
2 Kings 10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
2 Kings 10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
2 Kings 10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one
2 Kings 10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the
2 Kings 10:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,
2 Kings 10:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
2 Kings 10:8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
2 Kings 10:9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
2 Kings 10:11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
2 Kings 10:12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and
2 Kings 10:13 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
2 Kings 10:14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
2 Kings 10:15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
2 Kings 10:16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond
2 Kings 10:17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
2 Kings 10:18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
2 Kings 10:19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that
2 Kings 11:1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
2 Kings 11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off
2 Kings 11:3 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
2 Kings 11:4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
2 Kings 11:5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am
2 Kings 11:6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
2 Kings 11:7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab
2 Kings 11:8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
2 Kings 11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the
2 Kings 11:10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
2 Kings 11:12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
2 Kings 11:13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;
2 Kings 11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
2 Kings 11:15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
2 Kings 11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
2 Kings 11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
2 Kings 11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Kings 11:19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
2 Kings 11:22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
2 Kings 11:23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
2 Kings 11:24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
2 Kings 11:25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
2 Kings 11:26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
2 Kings 11:27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
2 Kings 12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
2 Kings 12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3
2 Kings 12:3 But the
2 Kings 12:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
2 Kings 12:5 And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
2 Kings 12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
2 Kings 12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
2 Kings 12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
2 Kings 12:11 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
2 Kings 12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
2 Kings 12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
2 Kings 12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
2 Kings 12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
2 Kings 12:16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
2 Kings 12:17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him
2 Kings 12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And
2 Kings 12:20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
2 Kings 12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
2 Kings 12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
2 Kings 12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
2 Kings 12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
2 Kings 12:26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
2 Kings 12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
2 Kings 12:28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
2 Kings 12:29 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
2 Kings 12:30 And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight
2 Kings 12:31 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
2 Kings 13:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had
2 Kings 13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
2 Kings 13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
2 Kings 13:4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean
2 Kings 13:5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
2 Kings 13:6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was
2 Kings 13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
2 Kings 13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.
2 Kings 13:9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
2 Kings 13:10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that
2 Kings 13:11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
2 Kings 13:12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
2 Kings 13:13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
2 Kings 13:14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
2 Kings 13:15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
2 Kings 13:16 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
2 Kings 13:17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
2 Kings 13:18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
2 Kings 13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
2 Kings 13:20 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
2 Kings 13:21 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
2 Kings 13:22 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
2 Kings 13:23 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
2 Kings 13:24 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant
2 Kings 13:25 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
2 Kings 13:26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go
2 Kings 13:27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s
2 Kings 13:28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
2 Kings 13:29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
2 Kings 13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
2 Kings 13:31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
2 Kings 13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and
2 Kings 13:33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
2 Kings 13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
2 Kings 13:35 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as
2 Kings 13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
2 Kings 13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
2 Kings 13:38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2 Kings 13:39 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for
2 Kings 14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was
2 Kings 14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
2 Kings 14:4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her
2 Kings 14:5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I
2 Kings 14:6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
2 Kings 14:7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
2 Kings 14:8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will
2 Kings 14:9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
2 Kings 14:10 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
2 Kings 14:11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
2 Kings 14:12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one
2 Kings 14:13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
2 Kings 14:14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
2 Kings 14:15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord
2 Kings 14:16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
2 Kings 14:17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now
2 Kings 14:18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
2 Kings 14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
2 Kings 14:21 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
2 Kings 14:22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
2 Kings 14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
2 Kings 14:24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
2 Kings 14:25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
2 Kings 14:26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end
2 Kings 14:27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
2 Kings 14:28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
2 Kings 14:29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
2 Kings 14:30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near
2 Kings 14:31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
2 Kings 14:33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
2 Kings 15:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
2 Kings 15:2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
2 Kings 15:3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;
2 Kings 15:4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
2 Kings 15:6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
2 Kings 15:7 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
2 Kings 15:8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
2 Kings 15:9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
2 Kings 15:10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
2 Kings 15:11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
2 Kings 15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s
2 Kings 15:13 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
2 Kings 15:14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
2 Kings 15:15 And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
2 Kings 15:16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
2 Kings 15:17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
2 Kings 15:18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
2 Kings 15:19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
2 Kings 15:20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
2 Kings 15:21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
2 Kings 15:22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
2 Kings 15:23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
2 Kings 15:24 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
2 Kings 15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
2 Kings 15:27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
2 Kings 15:28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
2 Kings 15:29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
2 Kings 15:30 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he
2 Kings 15:31 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
2 Kings 15:32 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
2 Kings 15:35 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
2 Kings 15:36 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
2 Kings 15:37 So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came
2 Kings 16:1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
2 Kings 16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
2 Kings 16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said
2 Kings 16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
2 Kings 16:5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
2 Kings 16:6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
2 Kings 16:7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
2 Kings 16:9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
2 Kings 16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
2 Kings 16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
2 Kings 16:13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
2 Kings 16:14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,
2 Kings 16:15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
2 Kings 16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,
2 Kings 16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?
2 Kings 16:19 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
2 Kings 16:20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
2 Kings 16:21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s
2 Kings 16:22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
2 Kings 16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
2 Kings 17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
2 Kings 17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
2 Kings 17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
2 Kings 17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
2 Kings 17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
2 Kings 17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
2 Kings 17:9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
2 Kings 17:10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
2 Kings 17:11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
2 Kings 17:12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,
2 Kings 17:13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
2 Kings 17:14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
2 Kings 17:15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
2 Kings 17:16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
2 Kings 17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
2 Kings 17:18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
2 Kings 17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth,
2 Kings 17:20 And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they
2 Kings 17:21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up
2 Kings 17:22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
2 Kings 17:23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
2 Kings 17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
2 Kings 17:25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
2 Kings 17:26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
2 Kings 17:27 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
2 Kings 17:28 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
2 Kings 18:1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
2 Kings 18:2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
2 Kings 18:3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
2 Kings 18:4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And
2 Kings 18:5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
2 Kings 18:6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
2 Kings 18:8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
2 Kings 18:9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
2 Kings 18:10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
2 Kings 18:11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
2 Kings 18:12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
2 Kings 18:13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:
2 Kings 18:14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
2 Kings 18:15 And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and
2 Kings 18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
2 Kings 18:17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
2 Kings 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
2 Kings 18:19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
2 Kings 18:20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
2 Kings 18:21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
2 Kings 18:22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
2 Kings 18:24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to
2 Kings 18:25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If
2 Kings 18:26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
2 Kings 18:27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
2 Kings 18:28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he
2 Kings 18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
2 Kings 18:30 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
2 Kings 18:31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
2 Kings 18:32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
2 Kings 18:33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
2 Kings 19:2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
2 Kings 19:3 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
2 Kings 19:4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
2 Kings 19:7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
2 Kings 19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all
2 Kings 19:9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
2 Kings 19:10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
2 Kings 19:12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then
2 Kings 19:14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
2 Kings 19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
2 Kings 19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
2 Kings 19:17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
2 Kings 19:18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s
2 Kings 19:20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,
2 Kings 19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
2 Kings 19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and
2 Kings 19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
2 Kings 19:27 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my
2 Kings 19:28 For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord
2 Kings 19:30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
2 Kings 19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
2 Kings 19:32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and
2 Kings 19:33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
2 Kings 19:34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that
2 Kings 19:38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will
2 Kings 19:39 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
2 Kings 19:40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
2 Kings 19:41 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
2 Kings 20:1 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
2 Kings 20:2 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
2 Kings 20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the
2 Kings 20:4 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
2 Kings 20:5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer
2 Kings 20:6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do
2 Kings 20:7 And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and
2 Kings 20:8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
2 Kings 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab
2 Kings 20:10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so
2 Kings 20:11 And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
2 Kings 20:12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
2 Kings 20:13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
2 Kings 20:14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
2 Kings 20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they
2 Kings 20:16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
2 Kings 20:17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
2 Kings 20:18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
2 Kings 20:19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou
2 Kings 20:21 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
2 Kings 20:22 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they
2 Kings 20:23 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of
2 Kings 21:1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
2 Kings 21:2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
2 Kings 21:3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
2 Kings 21:5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
2 Kings 21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
2 Kings 21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
2 Kings 21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
2 Kings 21:11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
2 Kings 21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
2 Kings 21:14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
2 Kings 21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
2 Kings 21:16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
2 Kings 21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
2 Kings 21:18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
2 Kings 21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
2 Kings 21:20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
2 Kings 21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
2 Kings 21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
2 Kings 22:1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
2 Kings 22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
2 Kings 22:5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men
2 Kings 22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
2 Kings 22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
2 Kings 22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under
2 Kings 22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the
2 Kings 22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
2 Kings 22:13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
2 Kings 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
2 Kings 22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
2 Kings 22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
2 Kings 22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
2 Kings 22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
2 Kings 22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
2 Kings 22:20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
2 Kings 22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to
2 Kings 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
2 Kings 22:23 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I
2 Kings 22:24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
2 Kings 22:25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
2 Kings 22:26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
2 Kings 22:27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
2 Kings 22:28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon
2 Kings 22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
2 Kings 22:30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped
2 Kings 22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
2 Kings 22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
2 Kings 22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
2 Kings 22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high
2 Kings 22:35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
2 Kings 22:36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
2 Kings 22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
2 Kings 22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
2 Kings 22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
2 Kings 22:40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose
2 Kings 22:41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
2 Kings 22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but
2 Kings 22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
2 Kings 22:44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
2 Kings 22:45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,
2 Kings 22:46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
2 Kings 22:47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
2 Kings 22:48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
2 Kings 22:49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
2 Kings 22:50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
2 Kings 22:51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to
2 Kings 23:1 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
2 Kings 23:3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
2 Kings 23:4 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
2 Kings 23:5 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
2 Kings 23:6 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
2 Kings 23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
2 Kings 23:9 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
2 Kings 23:11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
2 Kings 23:12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
2 Kings 23:13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
2 Kings 23:14 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
2 Kings 23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
2 Kings 23:17 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
2 Kings 23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
2 Kings 23:19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
2 Kings 23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
2 Kings 23:21 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
2 Kings 23:22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
2 Kings 23:23 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
2 Kings 23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
2 Kings 23:27 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28
2 Kings 23:28 Zalmon
2 Kings 24:1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and
2 Kings 24:2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
2 Kings 24:3 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
2 Kings 24:5 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right
2 Kings 24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
2 Kings 24:9 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
2 Kings 24:10 And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the
2 Kings 24:11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came
2 Kings 24:13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
2 Kings 24:14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now
2 Kings 24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
2 Kings 24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
2 Kings 24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
2 Kings 24:18 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
2 Kings 24:19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
2 Kings 24:20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
2 Kings 24:21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
2 Kings 24:22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer
2 Kings 24:23 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
2 Kings 24:24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of
2 Kings 24:25 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1 Kings 1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
1 Kings 1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
1 Kings 1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
1 Kings 1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
1 Kings 1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will
1 Kings 1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why
1 Kings 1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
1 Kings 1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan
1 Kings 1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
1 Kings 1:11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
1 Kings 1:13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not
1 Kings 1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
1 Kings 1:16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
1 Kings 1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
1 Kings 1:20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
1 Kings 1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
1 Kings 1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
1 Kings 1:23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
1 Kings 1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
1 Kings 1:26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
1 Kings 1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
1 Kings 1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
1 Kings 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
1 Kings 1:32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
1 Kings 1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
1 Kings 1:35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
1 Kings 1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
1 Kings 1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
1 Kings 1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
1 Kings 1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
1 Kings 1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
1 Kings 1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
1 Kings 1:43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
1 Kings 1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
1 Kings 1:45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
1 Kings 1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings 1:47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king
1 Kings 1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
1 Kings 1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
1 Kings 1:50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
1 Kings 1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
1 Kings 1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
1 Kings 1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
1 Kings 2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
1 Kings 2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
1 Kings 2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
1 Kings 2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
1 Kings 2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
1 Kings 2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
1 Kings 2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
1 Kings 2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
1 Kings 2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
1 Kings 2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
1 Kings 2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
1 Kings 2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
1 Kings 2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
1 Kings 2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
1 Kings 2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1 Kings 2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
1 Kings 2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
1 Kings 2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
1 Kings 2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
1 Kings 2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
1 Kings 2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and
1 Kings 2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
1 Kings 2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
1 Kings 2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;
1 Kings 2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
1 Kings 2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
1 Kings 2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
1 Kings 2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
1 Kings 2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell
1 Kings 2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
1 Kings 2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
1 Kings 2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
1 Kings 2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
1 Kings 2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
1 Kings 2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
1 Kings 2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
1 Kings 2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish
1 Kings 2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
1 Kings 2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
1 Kings 2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
1 Kings 2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
1 Kings 3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
1 Kings 3:2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no
1 Kings 3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
1 Kings 3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
1 Kings 3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and
1 Kings 3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
1 Kings 3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
1 Kings 3:8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
1 Kings 3:9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
1 Kings 3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
1 Kings 3:13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
1 Kings 3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
1 Kings 3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
1 Kings 3:16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
1 Kings 3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
1 Kings 3:18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
1 Kings 3:19 And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid
1 Kings 3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
1 Kings 3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it
1 Kings 3:22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
1 Kings 3:23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
1 Kings 3:24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
1 Kings 3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
1 Kings 3:26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
1 Kings 3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and
1 Kings 3:28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
1 Kings 4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings 4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
1 Kings 4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
1 Kings 4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
1 Kings 4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9
1 Kings 4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
1 Kings 4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
1 Kings 4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
1 Kings 4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
1 Kings 4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
1 Kings 4:22 And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
1 Kings 4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
1 Kings 4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
1 Kings 4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
1 Kings 4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
1 Kings 4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
1 Kings 4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
1 Kings 4:30 And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
1 Kings 4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
1 Kings 4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
1 Kings 4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
1 Kings 4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
1 Kings 5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
1 Kings 5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3
1 Kings 5:3 Thou knowest how that David
1 Kings 5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
1 Kings 5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD
1 Kings 5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
1 Kings 5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that
1 Kings 5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
1 Kings 5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
1 Kings 5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
1 Kings 5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food
1 Kings 5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there
1 Kings 5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
1 Kings 5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a
1 Kings 5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
1 Kings 5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
1 Kings 5:18 And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the
1 Kings 6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
1 Kings 6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
1 Kings 6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
1 Kings 6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
1 Kings 6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
1 Kings 6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
1 Kings 6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
1 Kings 6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
1 Kings 6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
1 Kings 6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12
1 Kings 6:12 Concerning
1 Kings 6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1 Kings 6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
1 Kings 6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
1 Kings 6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
1 Kings 6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
1 Kings 6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
1 Kings 6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
1 Kings 6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
1 Kings 6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
1 Kings 6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
1 Kings 6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
1 Kings 6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of
1 Kings 6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
1 Kings 6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
1 Kings 6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
1 Kings 6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
1 Kings 6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
1 Kings 6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:
1 Kings 6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
1 Kings 6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
1 Kings 6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
1 Kings 6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
1 Kings 6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and
1 Kings 6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
1 Kings 7:1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
1 Kings 7:2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
1 Kings 7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on
1 Kings 7:4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light
1 Kings 7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
1 Kings 7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
1 Kings 7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
1 Kings 7:8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,
1 Kings 7:9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
1 Kings 7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
1 Kings 7:11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,
1 Kings 7:12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
1 Kings 7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings 7:14 He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was
1 Kings 7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:
1 Kings 7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
1 Kings 7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
1 Kings 7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
1 Kings 7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
1 Kings 7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set
1 Kings 7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
1 Kings 7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
1 Kings 7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
1 Kings 7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
1 Kings 7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
1 Kings 7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
1 Kings 7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,
1 Kings 7:30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and
1 Kings 7:31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
1 Kings 7:32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
1 Kings 7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
1 Kings 7:34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
1 Kings 7:35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
1 Kings 7:36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
1 Kings 7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
1 Kings 7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
1 Kings 7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on
1 Kings 7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
1 Kings 7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
1 Kings 7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
1 Kings 7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
1 Kings 7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
1 Kings 8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
1 Kings 8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
1 Kings 8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
1 Kings 8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
1 Kings 8:5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
1 Kings 8:6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1 Kings 8:7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of
1 Kings 8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
1 Kings 8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
1 Kings 8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
1 Kings 8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
1 Kings 8:13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
1 Kings 8:14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
1 Kings 8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with
1 Kings 8:17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
1 Kings 8:18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
1 Kings 8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
1 Kings 8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
1 Kings 8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
1 Kings 8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
1 Kings 8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
1 Kings 8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
1 Kings 8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
1 Kings 8:27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
1 Kings 8:29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
1 Kings 8:30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
1 Kings 8:31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
1 Kings 8:33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
1 Kings 8:35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
1 Kings 8:37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
1 Kings 8:39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
1 Kings 8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
1 Kings 8:43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all
1 Kings 8:44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
1 Kings 8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)
1 Kings 8:47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
1 Kings 8:49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
1 Kings 8:51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
1 Kings 8:52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
1 Kings 8:53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
1 Kings 8:54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
1 Kings 8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a
1 Kings 8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him
1 Kings 8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
1 Kings 8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
1 Kings 8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before
1 Kings 8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
1 Kings 8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
1 Kings 8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
1 Kings 8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the
1 Kings 9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
1 Kings 9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
1 Kings 9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
1 Kings 9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
1 Kings 9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
1 Kings 9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
1 Kings 9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
1 Kings 9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
1 Kings 9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
1 Kings 9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1 Kings 9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for
1 Kings 9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
1 Kings 9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18
1 Kings 9:18 And
1 Kings 9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
1 Kings 9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
1 Kings 9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s
1 Kings 9:24 But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
1 Kings 9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
1 Kings 9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
1 Kings 9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
1 Kings 9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
1 Kings 10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
1 Kings 10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
1 Kings 10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing
1 Kings 10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and
1 Kings 10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
1 Kings 10:7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
1 Kings 10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
1 Kings 10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee
1 Kings 10:10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
1 Kings 10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
1 Kings 10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
1 Kings 10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
1 Kings 10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
1 Kings 10:16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
1 Kings 10:17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
1 Kings 10:18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
1 Kings 10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
1 Kings 10:20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
1 Kings 10:21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all
1 Kings 10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
1 Kings 10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
1 Kings 10:24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
1 Kings 10:25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
1 Kings 10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had
1 Kings 10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
1 Kings 10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
1 Kings 10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
1 Kings 11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
1 Kings 11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
1 Kings 11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
1 Kings 11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
1 Kings 11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
1 Kings 11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination
1 Kings 11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
1 Kings 11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
1 Kings 11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
1 Kings 11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
1 Kings 11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
1 Kings 11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
1 Kings 11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
1 Kings 11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
1 Kings 11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
1 Kings 11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
1 Kings 11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
1 Kings 11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
1 Kings 11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
1 Kings 11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
1 Kings 11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
1 Kings 11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
1 Kings 11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
1 Kings 11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
1 Kings 11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I
1 Kings 11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give
1 Kings 11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
1 Kings 11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that
1 Kings 11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
1 Kings 11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1 Kings 11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
1 Kings 11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
1 Kings 11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
1 Kings 11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
1 Kings 12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem
1 Kings 12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet
1 Kings 12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again
1 Kings 12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
1 Kings 12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
1 Kings 12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will
1 Kings 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
1 Kings 12:13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
1 Kings 12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause
1 Kings 12:16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
1 Kings 12:17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
1 Kings 12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
1 Kings 12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1 Kings 12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
1 Kings 12:21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
1 Kings 12:22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1 Kings 12:23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto
1 Kings 12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
1 Kings 12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to
1 Kings 12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
1 Kings 12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
1 Kings 12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
1 Kings 12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
1 Kings 12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
1 Kings 12:33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
1 Kings 13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of
1 Kings 13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
1 Kings 13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
1 Kings 13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
1 Kings 13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
1 Kings 13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now
1 Kings 13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
1 Kings 13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
1 Kings 13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came
1 Kings 13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
1 Kings 13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
1 Kings 13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
1 Kings 13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1 Kings 13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
1 Kings 13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
1 Kings 13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
1 Kings 13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
1 Kings 13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
1 Kings 13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
1 Kings 13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
1 Kings 13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,
1 Kings 13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
1 Kings 13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
1 Kings 13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
1 Kings 13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
1 Kings 13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
1 Kings 13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
1 Kings 13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
1 Kings 14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1 Kings 14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
1 Kings 14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
1 Kings 14:4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
1 Kings 14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
1 Kings 14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
1 Kings 14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch
1 Kings 14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
1 Kings 14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy
1 Kings 14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
1 Kings 14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
1 Kings 14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
1 Kings 14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who
1 Kings 14:17 And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
1 Kings 14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
1 Kings 14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
1 Kings 14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
1 Kings 14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
1 Kings 14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
1 Kings 14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
1 Kings 14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
1 Kings 14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
1 Kings 14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
1 Kings 14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are

1 Kings 15:10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
1 Kings 15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
1 Kings 15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
1 Kings 15:13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
1 Kings 15:14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart
1 Kings 15:15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and
1 Kings 15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
1 Kings 15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
1 Kings 15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
1 Kings 15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
1 Kings 15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
1 Kings 15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was

1 Kings 15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
1 Kings 15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
1 Kings 15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,
1 Kings 15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
1 Kings 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
1 Kings 15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
1 Kings 15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of

1 Kings 16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
1 Kings 16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
1 Kings 16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
1 Kings 16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
1 Kings 16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the
1 Kings 16:9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
1 Kings 16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty

1 Kings 16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
1 Kings 16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by

1 Kings 16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
1 Kings 16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
1 Kings 16:19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
1 Kings 16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
1 Kings 16:22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
1 Kings 16:23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
1 Kings 16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
1 Kings 16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
1 Kings 16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
1 Kings 16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
1 Kings 16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
1 Kings 16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
1 Kings 16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to
1 Kings 16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
1 Kings 16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
1 Kings 16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
1 Kings 17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
1 Kings 17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3
1 Kings 17:3 Get thee
1 Kings 17:4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
1 Kings 17:5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
1 Kings 17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
1 Kings 17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
1 Kings 17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9
1 Kings 17:9 Arise, get
1 Kings 17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
1 Kings 17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
1 Kings 17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
1 Kings 17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:
1 Kings 17:14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall
1 Kings 17:15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,
1 Kings 17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
1 Kings 17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
1 Kings 17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
1 Kings 17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
1 Kings 17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
1 Kings 17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
1 Kings 17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a
1 Kings 18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
1 Kings 18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
1 Kings 18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
1 Kings 18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
1 Kings 18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
1 Kings 18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
1 Kings 18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1 Kings 18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
1 Kings 18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
1 Kings 18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
1 Kings 18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
1 Kings 18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
1 Kings 18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
1 Kings 18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
1 Kings 18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
1 Kings 18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
1 Kings 18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
1 Kings 18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
1 Kings 18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed
1 Kings 18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
1 Kings 18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
1 Kings 18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
1 Kings 18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all
1 Kings 18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
1 Kings 18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
1 Kings 18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
1 Kings 18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
1 Kings 18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
1 Kings 18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
1 Kings 18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
1 Kings 18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
1 Kings 18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
1 Kings 18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there
1 Kings 18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
1 Kings 18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
1 Kings 18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
1 Kings 18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
1 Kings 19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he
1 Kings 19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
1 Kings 19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
1 Kings 19:4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came
1 Kings 19:5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
1 Kings 19:6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,
1 Kings 19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
1 Kings 19:8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of
1 Kings 19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
1 Kings 19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
1 Kings 19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in
1 Kings 19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
1 Kings 19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
1 Kings 19:18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
1 Kings 19:19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
1 Kings 19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I
1 Kings 19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
1 Kings 20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
1 Kings 20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and
1 Kings 20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
1 Kings 20:5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
1 Kings 20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
1 Kings 20:8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not
1 Kings 20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord
1 Kings 20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
1 Kings 20:11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him
1 Kings 20:12 And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he
1 Kings 20:13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
1 Kings 20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
1 Kings 20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
1 Kings 20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
1 Kings 20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
1 Kings 20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
1 Kings 20:19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
1 Kings 20:20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
1 Kings 20:21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
1 Kings 20:22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
1 Kings 20:23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods
1 Kings 20:24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
1 Kings 20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
1 Kings 20:27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,
1 Kings 20:28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,
1 Kings 20:29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
1 Kings 20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell
1 Kings 20:31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
1 Kings 20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
1 Kings 20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
1 Kings 20:34 And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
1 Kings 20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
1 Kings 20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of
1 Kings 20:37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And
1 Kings 20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
1 Kings 20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,
1 Kings 20:40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the
1 Kings 20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
1 Kings 20:42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let
1 Kings 20:43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
1 Kings 21:1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
1 Kings 21:2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I
1 Kings 21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
1 Kings 21:4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
1 Kings 21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
1 Kings 21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
1 Kings 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his
1 Kings 21:9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
1 Kings 21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were
1 Kings 21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1 Kings 21:13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
1 Kings 21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
1 Kings 21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
1 Kings 21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that
1 Kings 21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings 21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
1 Kings 21:19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast
1 Kings 21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
1 Kings 21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
1 Kings 21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
1 Kings 21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
1 Kings 21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
1 Kings 21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
1 Kings 21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
1 Kings 21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings 21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
1 Kings 22:1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
1 Kings 22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
1 Kings 22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
1 Kings 22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
1 Kings 22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
1 Kings 22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
1 Kings 22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
1 Kings 22:10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
1 Kings 22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
1 Kings 22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
1 Kings 22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
1 Kings 22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
1 Kings 22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
1 Kings 22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
1 Kings 22:18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
1 Kings 22:20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
1 Kings 22:21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
1 Kings 22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
1 Kings 22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
1 Kings 22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
1 Kings 22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
1 Kings 22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath
1 Kings 22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
1 Kings 22:30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
1 Kings 22:31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that
1 Kings 22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
1 Kings 22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
1 Kings 22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
1 Kings 22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in
1 Kings 22:36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
1 Kings 22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
1 Kings 22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
1 Kings 22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
1 Kings 22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
1 Kings 22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
1 Kings 22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
1 Kings 22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
1 Kings 22:44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings 22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
1 Kings 22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1 Kings 22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
1 Kings 22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
1 Kings 22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
1 Kings 22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
1 Kings 22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
2 Kings 1:1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings 1:2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
2 Kings 1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go
2 Kings 1:5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,
2 Kings 1:7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to
2 Kings 1:9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And
2 Kings 1:10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a
2 Kings 1:11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
2 Kings 1:12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
2 Kings 1:13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
2 Kings 1:14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
2 Kings 1:15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be
2 Kings 1:16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast
2 Kings 1:17 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
2 Kings 1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
2 Kings 2:2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
2 Kings 2:3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
2 Kings 2:4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
2 Kings 2:5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,
2 Kings 2:6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD
2 Kings 2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view
2 Kings 2:8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
2 Kings 2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said
2 Kings 2:10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou
2 Kings 2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
2 Kings 2:12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
2 Kings 2:13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
2 Kings 2:15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho
2 Kings 2:16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
2 Kings 2:17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They
2 Kings 2:18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
2 Kings 2:20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
2 Kings 2:21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
2 Kings 2:22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying
2 Kings 2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
2 Kings 2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
2 Kings 2:25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
2 Kings 3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
2 Kings 3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
2 Kings 3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
2 Kings 3:4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
2 Kings 3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
2 Kings 3:6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
2 Kings 3:7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The
2 Kings 3:8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way
2 Kings 3:9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of
2 Kings 3:10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
2 Kings 3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
2 Kings 3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
2 Kings 3:13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with
2 Kings 3:14 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
2 Kings 3:15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
2 Kings 3:16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
2 Kings 3:17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye
2 Kings 3:18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will
2 Kings 3:19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
2 Kings 3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
2 Kings 3:21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
2 Kings 3:22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
2 Kings 3:24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up
2 Kings 3:25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
2 Kings 3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
2 Kings 3:27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
2 Kings 4:1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
2 Kings 4:2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
2 Kings 4:3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
2 Kings 4:4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
2 Kings 4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
2 Kings 4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
2 Kings 4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
2 Kings 4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a
2 Kings 4:9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is
2 Kings 4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let
2 Kings 4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
2 Kings 4:12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when
2 Kings 4:13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
2 Kings 4:14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
2 Kings 4:15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in
2 Kings 4:16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
2 Kings 4:17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
2 Kings 4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out
2 Kings 4:19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a
2 Kings 4:20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat
2 Kings 4:21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and
2 Kings 4:22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,
2 Kings 4:23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither
2 Kings 4:24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
2 Kings 4:25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it
2 Kings 4:28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do
2 Kings 4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
2 Kings 4:31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
2 Kings 4:32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
2 Kings 4:33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
2 Kings 4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
2 Kings 4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
2 Kings 4:36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
2 Kings 4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
2 Kings 4:38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
2 Kings 4:39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
2 Kings 4:40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
2 Kings 4:41 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
2 Kings 4:42 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
2 Kings 4:43 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
2 Kings 4:44 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
2 Kings 5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great
2 Kings 5:2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
2 Kings 5:3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
2 Kings 5:4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
2 Kings 5:5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
2 Kings 5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when
2 Kings 5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
2 Kings 5:8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king
2 Kings 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at
2 Kings 5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
2 Kings 5:11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
2 Kings 5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
2 Kings 5:13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
2 Kings 5:15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
2 Kings 5:16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
2 Kings 5:17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to
2 Kings 5:18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
2 Kings 5:19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
2 Kings 5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,
2 Kings 5:21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
2 Kings 5:23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,
2 Kings 5:24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
2 Kings 5:25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
2 Kings 5:26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
2 Kings 6:1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
2 Kings 6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
2 Kings 6:3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.
2 Kings 6:4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
2 Kings 6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:
2 Kings 6:6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
2 Kings 6:7 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,
2 Kings 6:8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
2 Kings 6:9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
2 Kings 6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
2 Kings 6:11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
2 Kings 6:13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
2 Kings 6:14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:
2 Kings 6:15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
2 Kings 6:17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
2 Kings 6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
2 Kings 6:19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this
2 Kings 6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
2 Kings 6:21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
2 Kings 6:23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten
2 Kings 6:24 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
2 Kings 6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
2 Kings 6:26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
2 Kings 6:27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
2 Kings 6:29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
2 Kings 6:30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,
2 Kings 6:31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
2 Kings 6:32 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the
2 Kings 7:2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,
2 Kings 7:3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:
2 Kings 7:5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
2 Kings 7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
2 Kings 7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
2 Kings 7:8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
2 Kings 7:9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day
2 Kings 7:10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
2 Kings 7:11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house
2 Kings 7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
2 Kings 7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
2 Kings 7:14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after
2 Kings 7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
2 Kings 7:16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So
2 Kings 7:17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
2 Kings 7:18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
2 Kings 7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
2 Kings 8:1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
2 Kings 8:2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:
2 Kings 8:3 And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman
2 Kings 8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
2 Kings 8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
2 Kings 8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
2 Kings 8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was
2 Kings 8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and
2 Kings 8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:
2 Kings 8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
2 Kings 8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should
2 Kings 8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
2 Kings 8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
2 Kings 8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
2 Kings 8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
2 Kings 8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
2 Kings 8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s
2 Kings 8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made
2 Kings 8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
2 Kings 8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
2 Kings 8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they
2 Kings 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
2 Kings 8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and
2 Kings 8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
2 Kings 8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
2 Kings 8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
2 Kings 9:1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
2 Kings 9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
2 Kings 9:5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;
2 Kings 9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on
2 Kings 9:7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
2 Kings 9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
2 Kings 9:11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
2 Kings 9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
2 Kings 9:13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
2 Kings 9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
2 Kings 9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
2 Kings 9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
2 Kings 9:17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
2 Kings 9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
2 Kings 9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh
2 Kings 9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
2 Kings 9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
2 Kings 9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
2 Kings 9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
2 Kings 9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
2 Kings 9:28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
2 Kings 9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
2 Kings 9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
2 Kings 9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
2 Kings 9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
2 Kings 9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see
2 Kings 9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
2 Kings 9:36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
2 Kings 9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
2 Kings 10:1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
2 Kings 10:4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
2 Kings 10:6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
2 Kings 10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took
2 Kings 10:8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
2 Kings 10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
2 Kings 10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
2 Kings 10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at
2 Kings 10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
2 Kings 10:15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son
2 Kings 10:16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they
2 Kings 10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab
2 Kings 10:18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
2 Kings 10:19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
2 Kings 10:20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
2 Kings 10:21 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
2 Kings 10:22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
2 Kings 10:23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
2 Kings 10:24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
2 Kings 10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
2 Kings 10:26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
2 Kings 10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house
2 Kings 10:28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings 10:29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
2 Kings 10:30 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
2 Kings 10:31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
2 Kings 10:32 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
2 Kings 10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
2 Kings 10:36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty
2 Kings 11:1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
2 Kings 11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
2 Kings 11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
2 Kings 11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
2 Kings 11:5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
2 Kings 11:7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
2 Kings 11:8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
2 Kings 11:9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
2 Kings 11:10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
2 Kings 11:11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
2 Kings 11:12 And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him,
2 Kings 11:13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
2 Kings 11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
2 Kings 11:15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
2 Kings 11:16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which
2 Kings 11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
2 Kings 11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
2 Kings 11:19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
2 Kings 11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
2 Kings 11:21 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
2 Kings 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
2 Kings 12:2 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
2 Kings 12:3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
2 Kings 12:4 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated
2 Kings 12:6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
2 Kings 12:7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other
2 Kings 12:8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,
2 Kings 12:9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid
2 Kings 12:10 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
2 Kings 12:11 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that
2 Kings 12:13 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
2 Kings 12:14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
2 Kings 12:15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
2 Kings 12:16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house
2 Kings 12:17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and
2 Kings 12:18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
2 Kings 12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they
2 Kings 12:20 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in
2 Kings 12:21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
2 Kings 13:1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king
2 Kings 13:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
2 Kings 13:3 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
2 Kings 13:4 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:
2 Kings 13:5 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from
2 Kings 13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
2 Kings 13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
2 Kings 13:10 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
2 Kings 13:11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
2 Kings 13:12 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
2 Kings 13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
2 Kings 13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto
2 Kings 13:16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.
2 Kings 13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
2 Kings 13:18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto
2 Kings 13:19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest
2 Kings 13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
2 Kings 13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
2 Kings 13:22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
2 Kings 13:23 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,
2 Kings 13:24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
2 Kings 13:25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
2 Kings 14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
2 Kings 14:2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2 Kings 14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not
2 Kings 14:4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
2 Kings 14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
2 Kings 14:6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
2 Kings 14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
2 Kings 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
2 Kings 14:9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
2 Kings 14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee
2 Kings 14:11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
2 Kings 14:12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
2 Kings 14:13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2 Kings 14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
2 Kings 14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,
2 Kings 14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2 Kings 14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
2 Kings 14:20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
2 Kings 14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
2 Kings 14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2 Kings 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
2 Kings 14:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2 Kings 14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto
2 Kings 14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
2 Kings 14:27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel
2 Kings 14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
2 Kings 15:1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
2 Kings 15:2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Kings 15:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
2 Kings 15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
2 Kings 15:7 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
2 Kings 15:8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
2 Kings 15:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
2 Kings 15:10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
2 Kings 15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written
2 Kings 15:12 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,
2 Kings 15:13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
2 Kings 15:14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
2 Kings 15:15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
2 Kings 15:16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
2 Kings 15:17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
2 Kings 15:18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2 Kings 15:19 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
2 Kings 15:20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty
2 Kings 15:21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
2 Kings 15:22 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned
2 Kings 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
2 Kings 15:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2 Kings 15:25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
2 Kings 15:26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
2 Kings 15:27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the
2 Kings 15:28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2 Kings 15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
2 Kings 15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
2 Kings 15:31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,
2 Kings 15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
2 Kings 15:33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
2 Kings 15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did
2 Kings 15:35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed
2 Kings 15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
2 Kings 15:37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
2 Kings 15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
2 Kings 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son
2 Kings 16:2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
2 Kings 16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
2 Kings 16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2 Kings 16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
2 Kings 16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
2 Kings 16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
2 Kings 16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
2 Kings 16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
2 Kings 16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
2 Kings 16:11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king
2 Kings 16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
2 Kings 16:13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
2 Kings 16:14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,
2 Kings 16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
2 Kings 16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
2 Kings 16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
2 Kings 16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,
2 Kings 16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
2 Kings 17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of
2 Kings 17:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not
2 Kings 17:3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
2 Kings 17:4 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
2 Kings 17:5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
2 Kings 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
2 Kings 17:7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the
2 Kings 17:9 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
2 Kings 17:10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
2 Kings 17:13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all
2 Kings 17:14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
2 Kings 17:15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
2 Kings 17:16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
2 Kings 17:17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
2 Kings 17:18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them
2 Kings 17:19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but
2 Kings 17:20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
2 Kings 17:21 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
2 Kings 17:22 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
2 Kings 17:24 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
2 Kings 17:25 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
2 Kings 17:26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
2 Kings 17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of
2 Kings 17:28 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria
2 Kings 17:29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the
2 Kings 17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
2 Kings 17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest
2 Kings 17:33 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
2 Kings 17:34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
2 Kings 17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
2 Kings 17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;
2 Kings 17:39 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
2 Kings 17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
2 Kings 17:41 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
2 Kings 18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
2 Kings 18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
2 Kings 18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
2 Kings 18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none
2 Kings 18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
2 Kings 18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
2 Kings 18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
2 Kings 18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
2 Kings 18:10 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
2 Kings 18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and
2 Kings 18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
2 Kings 18:14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
2 Kings 18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
2 Kings 18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
2 Kings 18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
2 Kings 18:18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
2 Kings 18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
2 Kings 18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that
2 Kings 18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
2 Kings 18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
2 Kings 18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
2 Kings 18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
2 Kings 18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
2 Kings 18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
2 Kings 19:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
2 Kings 19:2 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the
2 Kings 19:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
2 Kings 19:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,
2 Kings 19:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings 19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus
2 Kings 19:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
2 Kings 19:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
2 Kings 19:9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
2 Kings 19:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
2 Kings 19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
2 Kings 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
2 Kings 19:16 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and
2 Kings 19:17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
2 Kings 19:19 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out
2 Kings 19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
2 Kings 19:21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
2 Kings 19:22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
2 Kings 19:23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,
2 Kings 19:24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my
2 Kings 19:25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
2 Kings 19:26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
2 Kings 19:27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
2 Kings 19:28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
2 Kings 19:29 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
2 Kings 19:30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet
2 Kings 19:31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
2 Kings 19:32 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
2 Kings 19:33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
2 Kings 19:34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and
2 Kings 19:35 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went
2 Kings 19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
2 Kings 19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
2 Kings 20:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
2 Kings 20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
2 Kings 20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
2 Kings 20:6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
2 Kings 20:7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it
2 Kings 20:8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
2 Kings 20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
2 Kings 20:12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
2 Kings 20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house
2 Kings 20:14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
2 Kings 20:15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
2 Kings 20:16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
2 Kings 20:17 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
2 Kings 20:18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
2 Kings 20:19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
2 Kings 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned
2 Kings 21:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
2 Kings 21:3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father
2 Kings 21:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD
2 Kings 21:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
2 Kings 21:6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
2 Kings 21:7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
2 Kings 21:9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
2 Kings 21:10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11
2 Kings 21:13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
2 Kings 21:14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver
2 Kings 21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
2 Kings 21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
2 Kings 21:19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
2 Kings 21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
2 Kings 21:21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
2 Kings 21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
2 Kings 21:24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
2 Kings 21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
2 Kings 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Kings 22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
2 Kings 22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that
2 Kings 22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that
2 Kings 22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
2 Kings 22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
2 Kings 22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
2 Kings 22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
2 Kings 22:12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of
2 Kings 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
2 Kings 22:15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
2 Kings 22:18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,
2 Kings 22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
2 Kings 23:1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of
2 Kings 23:2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men
2 Kings 23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
2 Kings 23:4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
2 Kings 23:5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah
2 Kings 23:6 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without
2 Kings 23:7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the
2 Kings 23:8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
2 Kings 23:9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
2 Kings 23:10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
2 Kings 23:11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to
2 Kings 23:12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
2 Kings 23:13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
2 Kings 23:14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
2 Kings 23:15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
2 Kings 23:16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
2 Kings 23:17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the
2 Kings 23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
2 Kings 23:19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
2 Kings 23:20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
2 Kings 23:21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
2 Kings 23:22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
2 Kings 23:24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and
2 Kings 23:25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
2 Kings 23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
2 Kings 23:27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as
2 Kings 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
2 Kings 23:29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king
2 Kings 23:30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
2 Kings 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings 23:32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 23:33 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
2 Kings 23:34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
2 Kings 23:35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
2 Kings 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings 23:37 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
2 Kings 24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of
2 Kings 24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
2 Kings 24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are
2 Kings 24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
2 Kings 24:7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
2 Kings 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
2 Kings 24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
2 Kings 24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
2 Kings 24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
2 Kings 24:13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
2 Kings 24:14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all
2 Kings 24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s
2 Kings 24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and
2 Kings 24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king
2 Kings 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
2 Kings 24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2 Kings 24:20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
2 Kings 25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
2 Kings 25:2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
2 Kings 25:3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in
2 Kings 25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night
2 Kings 25:5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook
2 Kings 25:6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon
2 Kings 25:7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out
2 Kings 25:8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is
2 Kings 25:10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of
2 Kings 25:11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
2 Kings 25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be
2 Kings 25:13 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and
2 Kings 25:14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,
2 Kings 25:15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
2 Kings 25:16 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
2 Kings 25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
2 Kings 25:18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
2 Kings 25:22 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
2 Kings 25:23 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
2 Kings 25:24 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
2 Kings 25:25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
2 Kings 25:26 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
2 Kings 25:27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
2 Kings 25:30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the

1 Chronicles 12:21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
1 Chronicles 12:22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
1 Chronicles 12:23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to
1 Chronicles 12:24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
1 Chronicles 12:25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
1 Chronicles 12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
1 Chronicles 12:27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were
1 Chronicles 12:29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
1 Chronicles 12:30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
1 Chronicles 12:31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
1 Chronicles 12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had

1 Chronicles 12:34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
1 Chronicles 12:35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
1 Chronicles 12:36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
1 Chronicles 12:37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
1 Chronicles 12:38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect
1 Chronicles 12:39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:
1 Chronicles 12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
1 Chronicles 13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
1 Chronicles 13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
1 Chronicles 13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired
1 Chronicles 13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
1 Chronicles 13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even
1 Chronicles 13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
1 Chronicles 13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
1 Chronicles 13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,
1 Chronicles 13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
1 Chronicles 13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
1 Chronicles 13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
1 Chronicles 13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring
1 Chronicles 13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
1 Chronicles 14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
1 Chronicles 14:2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
1 Chronicles 14:3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons
1 Chronicles 14:4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
1 Chronicles 14:8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over
1 Chronicles 14:9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
1 Chronicles 14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
1 Chronicles 14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then
1 Chronicles 14:12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
1 Chronicles 14:13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
1 Chronicles 14:14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go
1 Chronicles 14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
1 Chronicles 14:16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
1 Chronicles 14:17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
1 Chronicles 15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
1 Chronicles 15:2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
1 Chronicles 15:3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up
1 Chronicles 15:4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5
1 Chronicles 15:11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
1 Chronicles 15:13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a
1 Chronicles 15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up
1 Chronicles 15:15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
1 Chronicles 15:16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
1 Chronicles 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
1 Chronicles 15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
1 Chronicles 15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
1 Chronicles 15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1 Chronicles 15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
1 Chronicles 15:25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
1 Chronicles 15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
1 Chronicles 15:27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
1 Chronicles 15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1 Chronicles 15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
1 Chronicles 16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
1 Chronicles 16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
1 Chronicles 16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every
1 Chronicles 16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
1 Chronicles 16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
1 Chronicles 16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
1 Chronicles 16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
1 Chronicles 16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
1 Chronicles 16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
1 Chronicles 16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
1 Chronicles 16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
1 Chronicles 16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
1 Chronicles 16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
1 Chronicles 16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
1 Chronicles 16:24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among
1 Chronicles 16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to
1 Chronicles 16:26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the
1 Chronicles 16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are
1 Chronicles 16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
1 Chronicles 16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
1 Chronicles 16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable,
1 Chronicles 16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men
1 Chronicles 16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
1 Chronicles 16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
1 Chronicles 16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
1 Chronicles 16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
1 Chronicles 16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
1 Chronicles 16:37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1 Chronicles 16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
1 Chronicles 17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said
1 Chronicles 17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for
1 Chronicles 17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
1 Chronicles 17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any
1 Chronicles 17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
1 Chronicles 17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
1 Chronicles 17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
1 Chronicles 17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
1 Chronicles 17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
1 Chronicles 17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
1 Chronicles 17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?
1 Chronicles 17:19 O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own
1 Chronicles 17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside
1 Chronicles 17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom
1 Chronicles 17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
1 Chronicles 17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
1 Chronicles 17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
1 Chronicles 17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
1 Chronicles 18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
1 Chronicles 18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and
1 Chronicles 18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went
1 Chronicles 18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
1 Chronicles 18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
1 Chronicles 18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
1 Chronicles 18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
1 Chronicles 18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
1 Chronicles 18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the
1 Chronicles 18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
1 Chronicles 18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
1 Chronicles 18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
1 Chronicles 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
1 Chronicles 18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
1 Chronicles 18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
1 Chronicles 19:1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
1 Chronicles 19:2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
1 Chronicles 19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
1 Chronicles 19:5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.
1 Chronicles 19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
1 Chronicles 19:7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
1 Chronicles 19:8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
1 Chronicles 19:9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
1 Chronicles 19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
1 Chronicles 19:11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai
1 Chronicles 19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
1 Chronicles 19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
1 Chronicles 19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
1 Chronicles 19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
1 Chronicles 19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
1 Chronicles 19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
1 Chronicles 19:18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
1 Chronicles 19:19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
1 Chronicles 20:1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time
1 Chronicles 20:2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
1 Chronicles 20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with
1 Chronicles 20:4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
1 Chronicles 20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
1 Chronicles 20:6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
1 Chronicles 20:7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s
1 Chronicles 20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
1 Chronicles 21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
1 Chronicles 21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
1 Chronicles 21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so
1 Chronicles 21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And
1 Chronicles 21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s
1 Chronicles 21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
1 Chronicles 21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
1 Chronicles 21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 21:10
1 Chronicles 21:10 Go and
1 Chronicles 21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
1 Chronicles 21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now
1 Chronicles 21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
1 Chronicles 21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
1 Chronicles 21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
1 Chronicles 21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
1 Chronicles 21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
1 Chronicles 21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
1 Chronicles 21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with
1 Chronicles 21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
1 Chronicles 21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
1 Chronicles 21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
1 Chronicles 21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for
1 Chronicles 21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold
1 Chronicles 21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1 Chronicles 21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
1 Chronicles 21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
1 Chronicles 21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
1 Chronicles 21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
1 Chronicles 22:1 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is
1 Chronicles 22:2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in
1 Chronicles 22:3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
1 Chronicles 22:5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
1 Chronicles 22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an
1 Chronicles 22:7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind
1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;
1 Chronicles 22:10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and
1 Chronicles 22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build
1 Chronicles 22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee
1 Chronicles 22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
1 Chronicles 22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the
1 Chronicles 22:15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
1 Chronicles 22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
1 Chronicles 22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
1 Chronicles 22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
1 Chronicles 23:1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son
1 Chronicles 23:2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
1 Chronicles 23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
1 Chronicles 23:4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
1 Chronicles 23:5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised

1 Chronicles 23:24 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
1 Chronicles 23:25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his
1 Chronicles 23:27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
1 Chronicles 24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
1 Chronicles 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
1 Chronicles 24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
1 Chronicles 24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than
1 Chronicles 24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
1 Chronicles 24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,

1 Chronicles 28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and
1 Chronicles 28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant
1 Chronicles 28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
1 Chronicles 28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
1 Chronicles 28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house

1 Chronicles 28:20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
1 Chronicles 28:21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
1 Chronicles 29:1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
1 Chronicles 29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
1 Chronicles 29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,
1 Chronicles 29:4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
1 Chronicles 29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
1 Chronicles 29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
1 Chronicles 29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
1 Chronicles 29:11 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
1 Chronicles 29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;
1 Chronicles 29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
1 Chronicles 29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
1 Chronicles 29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
1 Chronicles 29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
1 Chronicles 29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
1 Chronicles 29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
1 Chronicles 29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
1 Chronicles 29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1 Chronicles 29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
1 Chronicles 29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
1 Chronicles 29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
1 Chronicles 29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
1 Chronicles 29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:
1 Chronicles 29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
2 Chronicles 1:1 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and
2 Chronicles 1:2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands
2 Chronicles 1:3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high
2 Chronicles 1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
2 Chronicles 1:5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
2 Chronicles 1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,
2 Chronicles 1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask
2 Chronicles 1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David
2 Chronicles 1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
2 Chronicles 1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
2 Chronicles 1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
2 Chronicles 1:14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand
2 Chronicles 1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
2 Chronicles 1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
2 Chronicles 1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for
2 Chronicles 2:1 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 2:2 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
2 Chronicles 2:3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst
2 Chronicles 2:4 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
2 Chronicles 2:5 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above
2 Chronicles 2:6 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
2 Chronicles 2:8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
2 Chronicles 2:10 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
2 Chronicles 2:11 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to
2 Chronicles 2:12 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made
2 Chronicles 2:13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of
2 Chronicles 2:15 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,
2 Chronicles 2:17 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
2 Chronicles 2:18 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
2 Chronicles 3:1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in
2 Chronicles 3:2 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in
2 Chronicles 3:3 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the
2 Chronicles 3:4 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it
2 Chronicles 3:5 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid
2 Chronicles 3:6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and
2 Chronicles 3:7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
2 Chronicles 3:8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according
2 Chronicles 3:9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
2 Chronicles 3:10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,
2 Chronicles 3:11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing
2 Chronicles 3:12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
2 Chronicles 3:13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
2 Chronicles 3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
2 Chronicles 3:15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
2 Chronicles 3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads
2 Chronicles 3:17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
2 Chronicles 4:1 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
2 Chronicles 4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
2 Chronicles 4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
2 Chronicles 4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
2 Chronicles 4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
2 Chronicles 4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five
2 Chronicles 4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and
2 Chronicles 4:8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on
2 Chronicles 4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
2 Chronicles 4:10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
2 Chronicles 4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
2 Chronicles 4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15
2 Chronicles 4:15 One
2 Chronicles 4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
2 Chronicles 4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
2 Chronicles 4:18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
2 Chronicles 4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,
2 Chronicles 4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn
2 Chronicles 5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was
2 Chronicles 5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
2 Chronicles 5:3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king
2 Chronicles 5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
2 Chronicles 5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
2 Chronicles 5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
2 Chronicles 5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
2 Chronicles 5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
2 Chronicles 5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
2 Chronicles 5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
2 Chronicles 6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the
2 Chronicles 6:2 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for
2 Chronicles 6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation
2 Chronicles 6:4 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his
2 Chronicles 6:7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
2 Chronicles 6:8 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
2 Chronicles 6:10 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:
2 Chronicles 6:11 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
2 Chronicles 6:12 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
2 Chronicles 6:14 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the
2 Chronicles 6:16 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
2 Chronicles 6:17 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which
2 Chronicles 6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
2 Chronicles 6:21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of
2 Chronicles 6:22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him
2 Chronicles 6:23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
2 Chronicles 6:24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
2 Chronicles 6:25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
2 Chronicles 6:26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
2 Chronicles 6:28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there
2 Chronicles 6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
2 Chronicles 6:34 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
2 Chronicles 6:36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
2 Chronicles 6:40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
2 Chronicles 6:41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
2 Chronicles 6:42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
2 Chronicles 7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
2 Chronicles 7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 7:3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
2 Chronicles 7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
2 Chronicles 7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
2 Chronicles 7:6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
2 Chronicles 7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
2 Chronicles 7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
2 Chronicles 7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
2 Chronicles 7:10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
2 Chronicles 7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s
2 Chronicles 7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
2 Chronicles 7:13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
2 Chronicles 7:15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
2 Chronicles 7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may
2 Chronicles 7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father
2 Chronicles 7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
2 Chronicles 7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every
2 Chronicles 8:1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon
2 Chronicles 8:3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
2 Chronicles 8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
2 Chronicles 8:5 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
2 Chronicles 8:7 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
2 Chronicles 8:9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
2 Chronicles 8:10 And these were the chief of king Solomon’s officers, even two
2 Chronicles 8:11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
2 Chronicles 8:12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar
2 Chronicles 8:14 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the
2 Chronicles 8:15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
2 Chronicles 8:16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
2 Chronicles 8:17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in
2 Chronicles 8:18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
2 Chronicles 9:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came
2 Chronicles 9:2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid
2 Chronicles 9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and
2 Chronicles 9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in
2 Chronicles 9:7 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand
2 Chronicles 9:8 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee
2 Chronicles 9:9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
2 Chronicles 9:10 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
2 Chronicles 9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
2 Chronicles 9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
2 Chronicles 9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
2 Chronicles 9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
2 Chronicles 9:16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
2 Chronicles 9:17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
2 Chronicles 9:18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
2 Chronicles 9:20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
2 Chronicles 9:21 For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
2 Chronicles 9:22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
2 Chronicles 9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to
2 Chronicles 9:24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
2 Chronicles 9:25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
2 Chronicles 9:26 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
2 Chronicles 9:27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees
2 Chronicles 9:28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all
2 Chronicles 9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not
2 Chronicles 9:31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city
2 Chronicles 10:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come
2 Chronicles 10:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in
2 Chronicles 10:3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
2 Chronicles 10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And
2 Chronicles 10:6 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
2 Chronicles 10:8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
2 Chronicles 10:9 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
2 Chronicles 10:11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more
2 Chronicles 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
2 Chronicles 10:13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
2 Chronicles 10:15 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of
2 Chronicles 10:16 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
2 Chronicles 10:17 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
2 Chronicles 10:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
2 Chronicles 10:19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2 Chronicles 11:1 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house
2 Chronicles 11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
2 Chronicles 11:3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
2 Chronicles 11:5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in
2 Chronicles 11:6 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7
2 Chronicles 11:7 And Bethzur,
2 Chronicles 11:11 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
2 Chronicles 11:12 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
2 Chronicles 11:13 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted
2 Chronicles 11:14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
2 Chronicles 11:16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their
2 Chronicles 11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the
2 Chronicles 11:18 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son
2 Chronicles 11:19 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles 11:20 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
2 Chronicles 11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
2 Chronicles 11:23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
2 Chronicles 12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
2 Chronicles 12:2 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
2 Chronicles 12:4 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came
2 Chronicles 12:5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
2 Chronicles 12:6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
2 Chronicles 12:7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of
2 Chronicles 12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
2 Chronicles 12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away
2 Chronicles 12:10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
2 Chronicles 12:11 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard
2 Chronicles 12:12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
2 Chronicles 12:13 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
2 Chronicles 12:14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
2 Chronicles 12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
2 Chronicles 12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
2 Chronicles 13:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign
2 Chronicles 13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
2 Chronicles 13:3 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
2 Chronicles 13:4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
2 Chronicles 13:7 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,
2 Chronicles 13:8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand
2 Chronicles 13:9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,
2 Chronicles 13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
2 Chronicles 13:12 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
2 Chronicles 13:13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so
2 Chronicles 13:14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
2 Chronicles 13:15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
2 Chronicles 13:16 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered
2 Chronicles 13:17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
2 Chronicles 13:18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and
2 Chronicles 13:19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
2 Chronicles 13:20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
2 Chronicles 13:21 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
2 Chronicles 13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
2 Chronicles 14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
2 Chronicles 14:2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD
2 Chronicles 14:5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
2 Chronicles 14:6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and
2 Chronicles 14:7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
2 Chronicles 14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of
2 Chronicles 14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host
2 Chronicles 14:10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array
2 Chronicles 14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
2 Chronicles 14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
2 Chronicles 14:13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
2 Chronicles 14:14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of
2 Chronicles 14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
2 Chronicles 15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2
2 Chronicles 15:2 And
2 Chronicles 15:3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and
2 Chronicles 15:4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
2 Chronicles 15:5 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor
2 Chronicles 15:6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did
2 Chronicles 15:7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your
2 Chronicles 15:8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
2 Chronicles 15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
2 Chronicles 15:10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
2 Chronicles 15:11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which
2 Chronicles 15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
2 Chronicles 15:14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
2 Chronicles 15:15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all
2 Chronicles 15:16 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
2 Chronicles 15:17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
2 Chronicles 15:18 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father
2 Chronicles 15:19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
2 Chronicles 16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of
2 Chronicles 16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
2 Chronicles 16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
2 Chronicles 16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
2 Chronicles 16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
2 Chronicles 16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and
2 Chronicles 16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
2 Chronicles 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
2 Chronicles 16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;
2 Chronicles 16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
2 Chronicles 16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
2 Chronicles 16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
2 Chronicles 16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for
2 Chronicles 17:1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
2 Chronicles 17:2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
2 Chronicles 17:3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
2 Chronicles 17:5 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
2 Chronicles 17:6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he
2 Chronicles 17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even
2 Chronicles 17:8 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
2 Chronicles 17:9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD
2 Chronicles 17:10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
2 Chronicles 17:11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
2 Chronicles 17:12 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
2 Chronicles 17:13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of
2 Chronicles 17:14 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
2 Chronicles 17:15 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
2 Chronicles 17:16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
2 Chronicles 17:17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
2 Chronicles 17:18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
2 Chronicles 17:19 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the
2 Chronicles 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
2 Chronicles 18:2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
2 Chronicles 18:3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
2 Chronicles 18:4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
2 Chronicles 18:5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
2 Chronicles 18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
2 Chronicles 18:8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,
2 Chronicles 18:9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
2 Chronicles 18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
2 Chronicles 18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
2 Chronicles 18:12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
2 Chronicles 18:13 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
2 Chronicles 18:14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
2 Chronicles 18:15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
2 Chronicles 18:16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,
2 Chronicles 18:17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
2 Chronicles 18:19 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he
2 Chronicles 18:20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
2 Chronicles 18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
2 Chronicles 18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah
2 Chronicles 18:25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
2 Chronicles 18:26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
2 Chronicles 18:27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
2 Chronicles 18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
2 Chronicles 18:29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
2 Chronicles 18:30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
2 Chronicles 18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
2 Chronicles 18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
2 Chronicles 18:33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
2 Chronicles 18:34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
2 Chronicles 19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
2 Chronicles 19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
2 Chronicles 19:3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
2 Chronicles 19:4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through
2 Chronicles 19:5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
2 Chronicles 19:7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and
2 Chronicles 19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of
2 Chronicles 19:9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
2 Chronicles 19:10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
2 Chronicles 19:11 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
2 Chronicles 20:1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and
2 Chronicles 20:2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
2 Chronicles 20:3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
2 Chronicles 20:4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:
2 Chronicles 20:5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 20:10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,
2 Chronicles 20:11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
2 Chronicles 20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
2 Chronicles 20:13 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
2 Chronicles 20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the
2 Chronicles 20:16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
2 Chronicles 20:17 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand
2 Chronicles 20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and
2 Chronicles 20:19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
2 Chronicles 20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
2 Chronicles 20:21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers
2 Chronicles 20:22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
2 Chronicles 20:23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
2 Chronicles 20:24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
2 Chronicles 20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
2 Chronicles 20:26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
2 Chronicles 20:27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
2 Chronicles 20:28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
2 Chronicles 20:29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,
2 Chronicles 20:30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
2 Chronicles 20:31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years
2 Chronicles 20:32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
2 Chronicles 20:33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
2 Chronicles 20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
2 Chronicles 20:35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
2 Chronicles 20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
2 Chronicles 21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
2 Chronicles 21:2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
2 Chronicles 21:3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
2 Chronicles 21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
2 Chronicles 21:5 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
2 Chronicles 21:7 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of
2 Chronicles 21:8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
2 Chronicles 21:9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
2 Chronicles 21:10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
2 Chronicles 21:11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
2 Chronicles 21:12 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
2 Chronicles 21:16 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
2 Chronicles 21:18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
2 Chronicles 21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
2 Chronicles 21:20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
2 Chronicles 22:1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
2 Chronicles 22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother
2 Chronicles 22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
2 Chronicles 22:5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son
2 Chronicles 22:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
2 Chronicles 22:7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
2 Chronicles 22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon
2 Chronicles 22:9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
2 Chronicles 22:10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
2 Chronicles 22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
2 Chronicles 22:12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
2 Chronicles 23:1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took
2 Chronicles 23:2 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all
2 Chronicles 23:3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
2 Chronicles 23:4 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering
2 Chronicles 23:6 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,
2 Chronicles 23:7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
2 Chronicles 23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
2 Chronicles 23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
2 Chronicles 23:10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
2 Chronicles 23:11 Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the
2 Chronicles 23:12 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
2 Chronicles 23:13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
2 Chronicles 23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
2 Chronicles 23:15 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering
2 Chronicles 23:16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
2 Chronicles 23:17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
2 Chronicles 23:18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
2 Chronicles 23:19 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 23:20 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
2 Chronicles 23:21 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
2 Chronicles 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Chronicles 24:2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
2 Chronicles 24:3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
2 Chronicles 24:4 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair
2 Chronicles 24:5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
2 Chronicles 24:6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
2 Chronicles 24:8 And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it
2 Chronicles 24:9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
2 Chronicles 24:10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
2 Chronicles 24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
2 Chronicles 24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
2 Chronicles 24:13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and
2 Chronicles 24:14 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
2 Chronicles 24:15 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
2 Chronicles 24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
2 Chronicles 24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
2 Chronicles 24:18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
2 Chronicles 24:19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;
2 Chronicles 24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
2 Chronicles 24:21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
2 Chronicles 24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
2 Chronicles 24:23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
2 Chronicles 24:24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
2 Chronicles 24:25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
2 Chronicles 24:26 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
2 Chronicles 24:27 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
2 Chronicles 25:1 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 25:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not
2 Chronicles 25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
2 Chronicles 25:4 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the
2 Chronicles 25:5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains
2 Chronicles 25:6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
2 Chronicles 25:7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the
2 Chronicles 25:8 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall
2 Chronicles 25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
2 Chronicles 25:10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
2 Chronicles 25:11 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and
2 Chronicles 25:12 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
2 Chronicles 25:13 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they
2 Chronicles 25:14 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
2 Chronicles 25:15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and
2 Chronicles 25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
2 Chronicles 25:18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
2 Chronicles 25:19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
2 Chronicles 25:21 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in
2 Chronicles 25:22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
2 Chronicles 25:23 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2 Chronicles 25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
2 Chronicles 25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2 Chronicles 25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
2 Chronicles 25:28 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
2 Chronicles 26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years
2 Chronicles 26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2 Chronicles 26:3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
2 Chronicles 26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding
2 Chronicles 26:6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake
2 Chronicles 26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
2 Chronicles 26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
2 Chronicles 26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and
2 Chronicles 26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
2 Chronicles 26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
2 Chronicles 26:12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
2 Chronicles 26:13 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
2 Chronicles 26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
2 Chronicles 26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be
2 Chronicles 26:16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
2 Chronicles 26:17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
2 Chronicles 26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
2 Chronicles 26:20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
2 Chronicles 26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
2 Chronicles 26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
2 Chronicles 26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
2 Chronicles 27:1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 27:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 27:3 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall
2 Chronicles 27:4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
2 Chronicles 27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
2 Chronicles 27:6 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the
2 Chronicles 27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
2 Chronicles 27:8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 27:9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2 Chronicles 28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Chronicles 28:3 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
2 Chronicles 28:4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2 Chronicles 28:5 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
2 Chronicles 28:6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
2 Chronicles 28:7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s
2 Chronicles 28:8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren
2 Chronicles 28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he
2 Chronicles 28:10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
2 Chronicles 28:12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
2 Chronicles 28:14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
2 Chronicles 28:15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
2 Chronicles 28:16 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
2 Chronicles 28:17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
2 Chronicles 28:18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,
2 Chronicles 28:19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
2 Chronicles 28:20 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
2 Chronicles 28:21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
2 Chronicles 28:22 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against
2 Chronicles 28:23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
2 Chronicles 28:24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and
2 Chronicles 28:25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
2 Chronicles 28:26 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
2 Chronicles 28:27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2 Chronicles 29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
2 Chronicles 29:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 29:3 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
2 Chronicles 29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
2 Chronicles 29:6 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in
2 Chronicles 29:7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
2 Chronicles 29:8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and
2 Chronicles 29:9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and
2 Chronicles 29:10 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
2 Chronicles 29:11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
2 Chronicles 29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
2 Chronicles 29:13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons
2 Chronicles 29:15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
2 Chronicles 29:16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
2 Chronicles 29:17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,
2 Chronicles 29:18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
2 Chronicles 29:19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
2 Chronicles 29:20 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
2 Chronicles 29:21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
2 Chronicles 29:22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood,
2 Chronicles 29:23 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
2 Chronicles 29:24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
2 Chronicles 29:25 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
2 Chronicles 29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
2 Chronicles 29:27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
2 Chronicles 29:28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
2 Chronicles 29:29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that
2 Chronicles 29:30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
2 Chronicles 29:31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
2 Chronicles 29:32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
2 Chronicles 29:33 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
2 Chronicles 29:34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
2 Chronicles 29:35 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of
2 Chronicles 29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared
2 Chronicles 30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
2 Chronicles 30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
2 Chronicles 30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had
2 Chronicles 30:4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2 Chronicles 30:5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
2 Chronicles 30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
2 Chronicles 30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
2 Chronicles 30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
2 Chronicles 30:9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
2 Chronicles 30:10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
2 Chronicles 30:11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
2 Chronicles 30:12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
2 Chronicles 30:13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
2 Chronicles 30:14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
2 Chronicles 30:16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
2 Chronicles 30:17 For there were many in the congregation that were not
2 Chronicles 30:18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
2 Chronicles 30:20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2 Chronicles 30:21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
2 Chronicles 30:22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
2 Chronicles 30:23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
2 Chronicles 30:24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
2 Chronicles 30:25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
2 Chronicles 30:26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
2 Chronicles 30:27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
2 Chronicles 31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went
2 Chronicles 31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
2 Chronicles 31:3 He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the
2 Chronicles 31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
2 Chronicles 31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
2 Chronicles 31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
2 Chronicles 31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
2 Chronicles 31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
2 Chronicles 31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
2 Chronicles 31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him,
2 Chronicles 31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
2 Chronicles 31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
2 Chronicles 31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
2 Chronicles 31:15 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
2 Chronicles 31:20 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
2 Chronicles 31:21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
2 Chronicles 32:1 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
2 Chronicles 32:2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
2 Chronicles 32:4 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
2 Chronicles 32:5 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
2 Chronicles 32:6 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
2 Chronicles 32:9 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
2 Chronicles 32:11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
2 Chronicles 32:17 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to
2 Chronicles 32:18 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the
2 Chronicles 32:19 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods
2 Chronicles 32:20 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the
2 Chronicles 32:21 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
2 Chronicles 32:22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
2 Chronicles 32:23 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents
2 Chronicles 32:24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
2 Chronicles 32:25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
2 Chronicles 32:26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
2 Chronicles 32:27 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
2 Chronicles 32:29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
2 Chronicles 32:30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,
2 Chronicles 32:31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
2 Chronicles 32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,
2 Chronicles 32:33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2 Chronicles 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
2 Chronicles 33:3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
2 Chronicles 33:4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD
2 Chronicles 33:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
2 Chronicles 33:6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
2 Chronicles 33:7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
2 Chronicles 33:9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
2 Chronicles 33:10 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
2 Chronicles 33:11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
2 Chronicles 33:12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
2 Chronicles 33:14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the
2 Chronicles 33:15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house
2 Chronicles 33:16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
2 Chronicles 33:17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,
2 Chronicles 33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
2 Chronicles 33:19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
2 Chronicles 33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
2 Chronicles 33:21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
2 Chronicles 33:22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
2 Chronicles 33:24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
2 Chronicles 33:25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
2 Chronicles 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Chronicles 34:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
2 Chronicles 34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he

Nehemiah 4:17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
Nehemiah 4:18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and
Nehemiah 4:19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of
Nehemiah 4:20 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort
Nehemiah 4:21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from
Nehemiah 4:22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one
Nehemiah 4:23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
Nehemiah 5:1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
Nehemiah 5:2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
Nehemiah 5:3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
Nehemiah 5:4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s
Nehemiah 5:5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
Nehemiah 5:6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah 5:7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
Nehemiah 5:8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
Nehemiah 5:9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
Nehemiah 5:11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
Nehemiah 5:12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of
Nehemiah 5:13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
Nehemiah 5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
Nehemiah 5:15 But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
Nehemiah 5:16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we
Nehemiah 5:17 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
Nehemiah 5:18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
Nehemiah 5:19 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have

Nehemiah 6:3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work,
Nehemiah 6:5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
Nehemiah 6:7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
Nehemiah 6:8 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
Nehemiah 6:9 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
Nehemiah 6:10 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
Nehemiah 6:11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,
Nehemiah 6:12 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
Nehemiah 6:13 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and
Nehemiah 6:14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
Nehemiah 6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
Nehemiah 6:16 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
Nehemiah 6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
Nehemiah 6:18 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the
Nehemiah 6:19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words
Nehemiah 7:1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
Nehemiah 7:2 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
Nehemiah 7:3 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened

Nehemiah 9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in
Nehemiah 9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
Nehemiah 9:16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,
Nehemiah 9:18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy

Nehemiah 12:44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
Nehemiah 12:45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God,
Nehemiah 12:46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
Nehemiah 12:47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
Nehemiah 13:1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the

Nehemiah 13:6 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
Nehemiah 13:8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
Nehemiah 13:9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
Nehemiah 13:10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been

Nehemiah 13:13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
Nehemiah 13:14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good

Nehemiah 13:17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
Nehemiah 13:18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
Nehemiah 13:19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
Nehemiah 13:20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Nehemiah 13:21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
Nehemiah 13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,

Nehemiah 13:25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
Nehemiah 13:26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
Nehemiah 13:27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to

Esther 1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by
Esther 1:13 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
Esther 1:17 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so
Esther 1:18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto

Esther 2:10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
Esther 2:11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s

Esther 2:19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
Esther 2:20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai

Esther 2:22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
Esther 2:23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
Esther 3:1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
Esther 3:2 And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed,
Esther 3:3 Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto
Esther 3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
Esther 3:6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
Esther 3:7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year
Esther 3:8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
Esther 3:9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be

Esther 3:13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces,
Esther 3:14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
Esther 3:15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and
Esther 4:1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
Esther 4:3 And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and
Esther 4:4 So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then
Esther 4:5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains,
Esther 4:6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
Esther 4:7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of
Esther 4:8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
Esther 4:9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther 4:10 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
Esther 4:12 And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther 4:13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
Esther 4:14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall
Esther 4:15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16
Esther 4:16 Go,

Esther 5:9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but
Esther 5:10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he
Esther 5:11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
Esther 5:12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in

Esther 6:4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into
Esther 6:5 And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in
Esther 6:6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done
Esther 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
Esther 6:11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
Esther 6:12 And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to

Esther 9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
Esther 9:14 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given
Esther 9:15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that
Job 1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job 1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
Job 1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
Job 1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
Job 1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
Job 1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
Job 1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
Job 1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
Job 1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy

Job 1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
Job 1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
Job 1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
Job 1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
Job 1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
Job 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
Job 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
Job 2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
Job 2:4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
Job 2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
Job 2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
Job 2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job
Job 2:8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat

Job 2:11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come
Job 2:12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
Job 2:13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
Job 3:1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
Job 3:2 And Job spake, and said, 3:3
Job 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was
Job 3:4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
Job 3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
Job 3:6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
Job 3:7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
Job 3:8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up
Job 3:9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
Job 3:11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
Job 3:14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
Job 3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at
Job 3:18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
Job 3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his
Job 3:20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto
Job 3:24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
Job 3:25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
Job 3:26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
Job 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 4:2
Job 4:2 If we assay to

Job 4:5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,
Job 4:6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the

Job 4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
Job 4:11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s
Job 4:12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
Job 4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
Job 4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood
Job 4:21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
Job 5:1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of
Job 5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
Job 5:4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
Job 5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
Job 5:6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth

Job 5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
Job 5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
Job 5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday
Job 5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from
Job 5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
Job 5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise
Job 5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall

Job 5:21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt
Job 5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be

Job 5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
Job 5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
Job 5:26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
Job 5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
Job 6:1 But Job answered and said, 6:2
Job 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly
Job 6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
Job 6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
Job 6:8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the
Job 6:11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
Job 6:15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream
Job 6:18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
Job 6:19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
Job 6:20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,
Job 6:21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
Job 6:22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
Job 6:25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job 6:26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
Job 6:28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
Job 6:29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
Job 6:30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
Job 7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
Job 7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
Job 7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without
Job 7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
Job 7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes
Job 7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
Job 7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
Job 7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
Job 7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13
Job 7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
Job 7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou

Job 8:2 How long wilt thou
Job 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly

Job 8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope
Job 8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall

Job 9:1 Then Job answered and said, 9:2
Job 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but
Job 9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
Job 9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
Job 9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
Job 9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves
Job 9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of
Job 9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
Job 9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
Job 9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
Job 9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
Job 9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe
Job 9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
Job 9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
Job 9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
Job 9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
Job 9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect
Job 9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
Job 9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
Job 9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
Job 9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
Job 9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 9:30
Job 9:30 If I wash myself
Job 9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
Job 9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand
Job 9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify
Job 10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
Job 10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
Job 10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
Job 10:8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;
Job 10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
Job 10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
Job 10:13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this
Job 10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
Job 10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
Job 10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
Job 10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
Job 10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
Job 11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2
Job 11:2 Should not
Job 11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6
Job 11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
Job 11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
Job 11:13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward
Job 11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
Job 11:18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt
Job 11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,
Job 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
Job 12:1 And Job answered and said, 12:2
Job 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,
Job 12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
Job 12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in
Job 12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
Job 12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls
Job 12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
Job 12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 12:12
Job 12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
Job 12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
Job 12:15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
Job 12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
Job 12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
Job 12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
Job 12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
Job 12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
Job 12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of
Job 12:22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to
Job 12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
Job 12:24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
Job 12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
Job 13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
Job 13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
Job 13:3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with
Job 13:4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
Job 13:5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
Job 13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
Job 13:7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
Job 13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 13:9
Job 13:9 Is it
Job 13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
Job 13:13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on
Job 13:14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
Job 13:16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
Job 13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
Job 13:18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
Job 13:19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,
Job 13:20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from
Job 13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
Job 13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
Job 13:23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
Job 13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
Job 13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
Job 13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
Job 13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
Job 14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
Job 14:2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as
Job 14:3 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me
Job 14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
Job 14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
Job 14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
Job 14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
Job 14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
Job 14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire
Job 14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
Job 14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock
Job 14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
Job 14:20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou

Job 15:2 Should a wise

Job 15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips
Job 15:7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
Job 15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret
Job 15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
Job 15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number
Job 15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
Job 15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is
Job 15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
Job 15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
Job 15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
Job 15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of
Job 15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
Job 15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
Job 15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his
Job 15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
Job 15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
Job 15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast
Job 15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
Job 15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
Job 16:1 Then Job answered and said, 16:2
Job 16:2 I have heard many such things:
Job 16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
Job 16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
Job 16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,
Job 16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against
Job 16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
Job 16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
Job 16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
Job 16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken
Job 16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
Job 16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like
Job 16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the
Job 16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of
Job 16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
Job 16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
Job 16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
Job 16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for
Job 17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready
Job 17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in
Job 17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
Job 17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was
Job 17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are
Job 17:8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
Job 17:9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean
Job 17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
Job 17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts
Job 17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
Job 17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
Job 17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou
Job 17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
Job 17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
Job 18:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2
Job 18:2 How long will it
Job 18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
Job 18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of
Job 18:6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall
Job 18:7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
Job 18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
Job 18:9 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail
Job 18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
Job 18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him
Job 18:12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
Job 18:13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of
Job 18:14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
Job 18:15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
Job 18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch
Job 18:17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
Job 18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
Job 18:19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
Job 18:20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
Job 18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
Job 19:1 Then Job answered and said, 19:2
Job 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,
Job 19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
Job 19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
Job 19:7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but
Job 19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
Job 19:9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
Job 19:10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope
Job 19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
Job 19:12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
Job 19:13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
Job 19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten
Job 19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
Job 19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
Job 19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
Job 19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against
Job 19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
Job 19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
Job 19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
Job 19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
Job 19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the
Job 20:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2
Job 20:2 Therefore do
Job 20:3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
Job 20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
Job 20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
Job 20:9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall
Job 20:10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall
Job 20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down
Job 20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under
Job 20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
Job 20:16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay
Job 20:17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
Job 20:18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
Job 20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he

Job 20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every
Job 20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
Job 20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall

Job 20:26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown
Job 20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
Job 20:28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow
Job 20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
Job 21:1 But Job answered and said, 21:2
Job 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and
Job 21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
Job 21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should
Job 21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
Job 21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
Job 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon
Job 21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
Job 21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
Job 21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the
Job 21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the
Job 21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
Job 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit
Job 21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh
Job 21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
Job 21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
Job 21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
Job 21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
Job 21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
Job 21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
Job 21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
Job 21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover
Job 21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye

Job 21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
Job 21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
Job 21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
Job 22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
Job 22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable
Job 22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless
Job 22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth
Job 22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
Job 22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job 22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown
Job 22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them
Job 22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
Job 22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
Job 22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his

Job 22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as

Job 22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt

Job 23:1 Then Job answered and said, 23:2
Job 23:2 Even to day is my complaint
Job 23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to
Job 23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
Job 23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would
Job 23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
Job 23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I

Job 23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
Job 23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
Job 23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
Job 23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
Job 24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that
Job 24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s
Job 24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
Job 24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
Job 24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
Job 24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no
Job 24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the
Job 24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of
Job 24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away
Job 24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
Job 24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
Job 24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
Job 24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,
Job 24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
Job 24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
Job 24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:
Job 24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
Job 24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
Job 24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
Job 24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no

Job 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the

Job 26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud
Job 26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and

Job 26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he

Job 26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
Job 27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my
Job 27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
Job 27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
Job 27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me
Job 27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
Job 27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
Job 27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his

Job 27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a

Job 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the

Job 28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
Job 28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned
Job 28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of
Job 28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s
Job 28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the

Job 28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
Job 28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
Job 28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
Job 28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
Job 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
Job 28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
Job 28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
Job 28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
Job 28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place

Job 28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
Job 29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2
Job 29:2 Oh that I were
Job 29:8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and
Job 29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
Job 29:10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
Job 29:11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
Job 29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I
Job 29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a
Job 29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
Job 29:16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
Job 29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
Job 29:18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
Job 29:19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night
Job 29:20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Job 29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
Job 29:22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon
Job 29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
Job 29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
Job 29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the
Job 30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose
Job 30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom
Job 30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
Job 30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as
Job 30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
Job 30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were
Job 30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
Job 30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
Job 30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also
Job 30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
Job 30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
Job 30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
Job 30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and
Job 30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
Job 30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
Job 30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
Job 30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
Job 30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
Job 30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
Job 30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
Job 30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
Job 30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
Job 30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
Job 30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
Job 30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
Job 30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
Job 30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
Job 30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice
Job 31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a
Job 31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
Job 31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
Job 31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
Job 31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
Job 31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
Job 31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
Job 31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with
Job 31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
Job 31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou
Job 31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted
Job 31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
Job 31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
Job 31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
Job 31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown
Job 31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
Job 31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
Job 32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
Job 32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
Job 32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
Job 32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder
Job 32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
Job 32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am
Job 32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
Job 32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty
Job 32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
Job 32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
Job 32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
Job 32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
Job 32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
Job 32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
Job 32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
Job 32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
Job 32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
Job 32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
Job 32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me
Job 32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
Job 33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all
Job 33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my
Job 33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
Job 33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
Job 33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand
Job 33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am
Job 33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
Job 33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
Job 33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his
Job 33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God
Job 33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
Job 33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
Job 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
Job 33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
Job 33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
Job 33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
Job 33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
Job 33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
Job 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to
Job 33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
Job 33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30
Job 33:30 To
Job 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
Job 33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to
Job 33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee
Job 34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2
Job 34:2 Hear my words, O ye
Job 34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
Job 34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is
Job 34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
Job 34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
Job 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 34:8
Job 34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
Job 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
Job 34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every
Job 34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
Job 34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed
Job 34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice
Job 34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
Job 34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
Job 34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
Job 34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of
Job 34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
Job 34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
Job 34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the
Job 34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job 34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of
Job 34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
Job 34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
Job 34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
Job 34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
Job 34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
Job 34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
Job 34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
Job 35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2
Job 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be
Job 35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are
Job 35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
Job 35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
Job 35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
Job 35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
Job 35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
Job 35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet
Job 36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2
Job 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I
Job 36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
Job 36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
Job 36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
Job 36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
Job 36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
Job 36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
Job 36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
Job 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
Job 36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
Job 36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he
Job 36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
Job 36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears
Job 36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
Job 36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
Job 36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
Job 36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
Job 36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
Job 36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
Job 36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 36:23
Job 36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
Job 36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
Job 36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
Job 36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job 36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
Job 36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
Job 37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
Job 37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth
Job 37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
Job 37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
Job 37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
Job 37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the
Job 37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his

Job 37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job 37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
Job 37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his
Job 37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,
Job 37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous
Job 37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
Job 37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
Job 37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
Job 37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but
Job 37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
Job 37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
Job 37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
Job 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2
Job 38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Job 38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
Job 38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it
Job 38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm
Job 38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
Job 38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
Job 38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
Job 38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
Job 39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
Job 39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they
Job 39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands
Job 39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the
Job 39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after
Job 39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
Job 39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will
Job 39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not
Job 39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse
Job 39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
Job 39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth

Psalm 69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
Psalm 69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
Psalm 69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
Psalm 69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
Psalm 69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
Psalm 69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
Psalm 69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
Psalm 69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
Psalm 69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
Psalm 69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
Psalm 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
Psalm 69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be

Psalm 69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
Psalm 69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
Psalm 69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
Psalm 69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
Psalm 69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I

Psalm 69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
Psalm 69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
Psalm 69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
Psalm 69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
Psalm 69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
Psalm 69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy

Psalm 69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up
Psalm 69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
Psalm 69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
Psalm 69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall

Psalm 69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
Psalm 69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that
Psalm 69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that

Psalm 70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let
Psalm 70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
Psalm 70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
Psalm 70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my
Psalm 71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
Psalm 71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
Psalm 71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
Psalm 71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
Psalm 71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
Psalm 71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
Psalm 71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
Psalm 71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
Psalm 71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my

Psalm 71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there
Psalm 71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
Psalm 71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
Psalm 71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
Psalm 71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
Psalm 71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
Psalm 71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
Psalm 71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
Psalm 71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
Psalm 71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
Psalm 71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
Psalm 71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
Psalm 71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
Psalm 71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
Psalm 72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
Psalm 72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
Psalm 72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
Psalm 72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
Psalm 72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
Psalm 72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
Psalm 72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace
Psalm 72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
Psalm 72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
Psalm 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
Psalm 72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
Psalm 72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
Psalm 72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
Psalm 72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
Psalm 72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
Psalm 72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
Psalm 72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
Psalm 72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
Psalm 72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
Psalm 72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psalm 73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
Psalm 73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
Psalm 73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
Psalm 73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
Psalm 73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
Psalm 73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
Psalm 73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
Psalm 73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they
Psalm 73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
Psalm 73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are
Psalm 73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
Psalm 73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
Psalm 73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
Psalm 73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
Psalm 73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
Psalm 73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
Psalm 73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
Psalm 73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
Psalm 73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
Psalm 73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
Psalm 73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Psalm 73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
Psalm 73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by
Psalm 73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
Psalm 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
Psalm 73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
Psalm 73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
Psalm 73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
Psalm 74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger
Psalm 74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the
Psalm 74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
Psalm 74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
Psalm 74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
Psalm 74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
Psalm 74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
Psalm 74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
Psalm 74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
Psalm 74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
Psalm 74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out
Psalm 74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
Psalm 74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
Psalm 74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
Psalm 74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
Psalm 74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
Psalm 74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
Psalm 74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
Psalm 74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
Psalm 74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth
Psalm 74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
Psalm 74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
Psalm 74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that
Psalm 75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
Psalm 75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
Psalm 75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear
Psalm 75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
Psalm 75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
Psalm 75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
Psalm 75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
Psalm 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;
Psalm 75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
Psalm 75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
Psalm 76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
Psalm 76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
Psalm 76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,
Psalm 76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
Psalm 76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
Psalm 76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
Psalm 76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
Psalm 76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
Psalm 76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
Psalm 76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
Psalm 76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about
Psalm 76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
Psalm 77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and
Psalm 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
Psalm 77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit
Psalm 77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
Psalm 77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
Psalm 77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine
Psalm 77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
Psalm 77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
Psalm 77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
Psalm 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years
Psalm 77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
Psalm 77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psalm 77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
Psalm 77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
Psalm 77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob
Psalm 77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
Psalm 77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
Psalm 77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
Psalm 77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
Psalm 77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
Psalm 78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words
Psalm 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
Psalm 78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psalm 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
Psalm 78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
Psalm 78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
Psalm 78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
Psalm 78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
Psalm 78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
Psalm 78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
Psalm 78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psalm 78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
Psalm 78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made
Psalm 78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
Psalm 78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
Psalm 78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
Psalm 78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
Psalm 78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
Psalm 78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
Psalm 78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
Psalm 78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
Psalm 78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
Psalm 78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
Psalm 78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
Psalm 78:25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psalm 78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
Psalm 78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like
Psalm 78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
Psalm 78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
Psalm 78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
Psalm 78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
Psalm 78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
Psalm 78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
Psalm 78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
Psalm 78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
Psalm 78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
Psalm 78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
Psalm 78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
Psalm 78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
Psalm 78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
Psalm 78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
Psalm 78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
Psalm 78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
Psalm 78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
Psalm 78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
Psalm 78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
Psalm 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
Psalm 78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
Psalm 78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
Psalm 78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,
Psalm 78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
Psalm 78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
Psalm 78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
Psalm 78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
Psalm 78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
Psalm 78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
Psalm 78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
Psalm 78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved
Psalm 78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psalm 78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
Psalm 78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
Psalm 78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
Psalm 78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
Psalm 78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
Psalm 78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
Psalm 78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
Psalm 78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
Psalm 78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psalm 78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
Psalm 78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
Psalm 78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Psalm 78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
Psalm 79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
Psalm 79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
Psalm 79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
Psalm 79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
Psalm 79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy
Psalm 79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
Psalm 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psalm 79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
Psalm 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
Psalm 79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
Psalm 79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
Psalm 79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
Psalm 79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
Psalm 80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
Psalm 80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
Psalm 80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall
Psalm 80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
Psalm 80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears
Psalm 80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
Psalm 80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
Psalm 80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
Psalm 80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
Psalm 80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
Psalm 80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
Psalm 80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
Psalm 80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
Psalm 80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,
Psalm 80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
Psalm 80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
Psalm 80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of
Psalm 80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
Psalm 80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
Psalm 81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
Psalm 81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
Psalm 81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
Psalm 81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
Psalm 81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
Psalm 81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered
Psalm 81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
Psalm 81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
Psalm 81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship
Psalm 81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
Psalm 81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
Psalm 81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked
Psalm 81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
Psalm 81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
Psalm 81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
Psalm 81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
Psalm 82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among
Psalm 82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
Psalm 82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and
Psalm 82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
Psalm 82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
Psalm 82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
Psalm 82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psalm 82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
Psalm 83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
Psalm 83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
Psalm 83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
Psalm 83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
Psalm 83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
Psalm 83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
Psalm 83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
Psalm 83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of
Psalm 83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
Psalm 83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psalm 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
Psalm 83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
Psalm 83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
Psalm 83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
Psalm 83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
Psalm 83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
Psalm 83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
Psalm 83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
Psalm 84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psalm 84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
Psalm 84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
Psalm 84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
Psalm 84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are
Psalm 84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain
Psalm 84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
Psalm 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
Psalm 84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
Psalm 84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather
Psalm 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
Psalm 84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
Psalm 85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought
Psalm 85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
Psalm 85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from
Psalm 85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
Psalm 85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
Psalm 85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
Psalm 85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
Psalm 85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace
Psalm 85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may
Psalm 85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
Psalm 85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
Psalm 85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
Psalm 85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
Psalm 86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
Psalm 86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant
Psalm 86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Psalm 86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
Psalm 86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
Psalm 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
Psalm 86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
Psalm 86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are

Psalm 86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
Psalm 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
Psalm 86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
Psalm 86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
Psalm 86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
Psalm 86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
Psalm 86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto

Psalm 87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
Psalm 87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:
Psalm 87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
Psalm 87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:
Psalm 88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
Psalm 88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psalm 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
Psalm 88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man
Psalm 88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
Psalm 88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psalm 88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
Psalm 88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
Psalm 88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
Psalm 88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
Psalm 88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
Psalm 88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in
Psalm 88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
Psalm 88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
Psalm 88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer
Psalm 88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psalm 88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
Psalm 88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
Psalm 89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
Psalm 89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
Psalm 89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
Psalm 89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
Psalm 89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
Psalm 89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
Psalm 89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
Psalm 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
Psalm 89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,
Psalm 89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
Psalm 89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world
Psalm 89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
Psalm 89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
Psalm 89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and
Psalm 89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
Psalm 89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
Psalm 89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our
Psalm 89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
Psalm 89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
Psalm 89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
Psalm 89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
Psalm 89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
Psalm 89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
Psalm 89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
Psalm 89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
Psalm 89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
Psalm 89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
Psalm 89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
Psalm 89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
Psalm 89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
Psalm 89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
Psalm 89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
Psalm 89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
Psalm 89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
Psalm 89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
Psalm 89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before
Psalm 89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
Psalm 89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
Psalm 89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
Psalm 89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
Psalm 89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
Psalm 89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
Psalm 89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
Psalm 89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
Psalm 89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
Psalm 89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
Psalm 89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men
Psalm 89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
Psalm 89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
Psalm 89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
Psalm 89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
Psalm 89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
Psalm 90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Psalm 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
Psalm 90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
Psalm 90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
Psalm 90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in

Psalm 91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
Psalm 91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;
Psalm 91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
Psalm 91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
Psalm 91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
Psalm 91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
Psalm 91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
Psalm 91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
Psalm 91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
Psalm 91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
Psalm 91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
Psalm 91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
Psalm 91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
Psalm 91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
Psalm 91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him
Psalm 91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
Psalm 92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
Psalm 92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy

Psalm 94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
Psalm 94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
Psalm 94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
Psalm 94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
Psalm 94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
Psalm 94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will

Psalm 94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
Psalm 94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until
Psalm 94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he

Psalm 94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
Psalm 94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
Psalm 94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
Psalm 94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which

Psalm 95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
Psalm 95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,

Psalm 102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
Psalm 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
Psalm 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
Psalm 102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
Psalm 102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
Psalm 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with

Psalm 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
Psalm 102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
Psalm 102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
Psalm 102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
Psalm 102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
Psalm 102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to

Psalm 103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
Psalm 103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
Psalm 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
Psalm 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
Psalm 103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
Psalm 103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Psalm 103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so

Psalm 103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
Psalm 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
Psalm 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
Psalm 104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
Psalm 104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
Psalm 104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psalm 104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
Psalm 104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
Psalm 104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
Psalm 104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
Psalm 104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
Psalm 104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
Psalm 104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
Psalm 104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
Psalm 104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
Psalm 104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
Psalm 104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
Psalm 104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
Psalm 104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
Psalm 104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
Psalm 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
Psalm 104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
Psalm 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
Psalm 104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
Psalm 104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
Psalm 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
Psalm 104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
Psalm 104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
Psalm 104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
Psalm 104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
Psalm 104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
Psalm 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
Psalm 104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
Psalm 104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the

Psalm 104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
Psalm 104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
Psalm 105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
Psalm 105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
Psalm 105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
Psalm 105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psalm 105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
Psalm 105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
Psalm 105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
Psalm 105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
Psalm 105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psalm 105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
Psalm 105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
Psalm 105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
Psalm 105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
Psalm 105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
Psalm 105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Psalm 105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
Psalm 105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
Psalm 105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psalm 105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
Psalm 105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
Psalm 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psalm 105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
Psalm 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Psalm 105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
Psalm 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
Psalm 105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psalm 105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
Psalm 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
Psalm 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psalm 105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
Psalm 105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
Psalm 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
Psalm 105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
Psalm 105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
Psalm 105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
Psalm 105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
Psalm 105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
Psalm 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
Psalm 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the

Psalm 106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

Ecclesiastes 1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
Ecclesiastes 1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
Ecclesiastes 1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is
Ecclesiastes 1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great

Ecclesiastes 2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 2:3
Ecclesiastes 2:3 I
Ecclesiastes 2:4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
Ecclesiastes 2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
Ecclesiastes 2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
Ecclesiastes 2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on
Ecclesiastes 2:12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
Ecclesiastes 2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
Ecclesiastes 2:14 The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
Ecclesiastes 2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
Ecclesiastes 2:16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
Ecclesiastes 2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
Ecclesiastes 2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
Ecclesiastes 2:19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
Ecclesiastes 2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the

Ecclesiastes 2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and

Ecclesiastes 3:9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

Ecclesiastes 3:15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
Ecclesiastes 3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
Ecclesiastes 3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
Ecclesiastes 3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
Ecclesiastes 3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even

Ecclesiastes 5:13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
Ecclesiastes 5:14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,
Ecclesiastes 5:15 As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to
Ecclesiastes 5:16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so
Ecclesiastes 5:17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow

Ecclesiastes 6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
Ecclesiastes 6:10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
Ecclesiastes 6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
Ecclesiastes 7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
Ecclesiastes 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
Ecclesiastes 7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
Ecclesiastes 7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
Ecclesiastes 7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of
Ecclesiastes 7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
Ecclesiastes 7:8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the
Ecclesiastes 7:9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
Ecclesiastes 7:10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better
Ecclesiastes 7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
Ecclesiastes 7:12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
Ecclesiastes 7:13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which
Ecclesiastes 7:15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just
Ecclesiastes 7:16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
Ecclesiastes 7:19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
Ecclesiastes 7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
Ecclesiastes 7:21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear
Ecclesiastes 7:23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
Ecclesiastes 7:24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
Ecclesiastes 7:25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
Ecclesiastes 7:27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
Ecclesiastes 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but
Ecclesiastes 8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
Ecclesiastes 8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard
Ecclesiastes 8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto
Ecclesiastes 8:6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
Ecclesiastes 8:7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when
Ecclesiastes 8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is
Ecclesiastes 8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the

Ecclesiastes 9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
Ecclesiastes 9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken
Ecclesiastes 9:13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great
Ecclesiastes 9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the

Song of Solomon 5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my
Song of Solomon 5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh,
Song of Solomon 5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and
Song of Solomon 5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,

Song of Solomon 5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as
Song of Solomon 5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
Song of Solomon 5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my

Isaiah 18:7 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts
Isaiah 19:1 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,
Isaiah 19:2 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
Isaiah 19:3 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
Isaiah 19:4 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
Isaiah 19:5 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
Isaiah 19:6 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
Isaiah 19:7 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
Isaiah 19:8 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into
Isaiah 19:9 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave

Isaiah 19:15 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or

Isaiah 22:1 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
Isaiah 22:3 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers:
Isaiah 22:4 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour
Isaiah 22:5 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of

Isaiah 23:6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
Isaiah 23:7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her

Isaiah 23:10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there
Isaiah 23:11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
Isaiah 23:12 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed

Isaiah 24:1 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
Isaiah 24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with
Isaiah 24:3 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the
Isaiah 24:4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
Isaiah 24:5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because
Isaiah 24:6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell
Isaiah 24:7 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted
Isaiah 24:8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
Isaiah 24:9 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
Isaiah 24:10 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
Isaiah 24:11 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened,
Isaiah 24:12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
Isaiah 24:13 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,
Isaiah 24:14 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty
Isaiah 24:15 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the
Isaiah 24:16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
Isaiah 24:17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of
Isaiah 24:18 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
Isaiah 24:19 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved,
Isaiah 24:20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be

Isaiah 25:2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin:
Isaiah 25:3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the
Isaiah 25:4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
Isaiah 25:5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a

Isaiah 25:7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
Isaiah 25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe

Isaiah 26:11 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
Isaiah 26:12 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought
Isaiah 26:13 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
Isaiah 26:14 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
Isaiah 26:15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
Isaiah 26:16 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a

Isaiah 27:3 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
Isaiah 27:4 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me
Isaiah 27:5 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with
Isaiah 27:6 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall

Isaiah 27:9 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this
Isaiah 27:10 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
Isaiah 27:11 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off:
Isaiah 27:12 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat
Isaiah 27:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
Isaiah 28:1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
Isaiah 28:3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
Isaiah 28:5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and
Isaiah 28:7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
Isaiah 28:8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is
Isaiah 28:9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
Isaiah 28:10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
Isaiah 28:12 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
Isaiah 28:13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
Isaiah 28:14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule
Isaiah 28:15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
Isaiah 28:17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
Isaiah 28:18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
Isaiah 28:19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning
Isaiah 28:20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
Isaiah 28:21 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
Isaiah 28:22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:
Isaiah 28:23 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
Isaiah 28:24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
Isaiah 28:27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
Isaiah 28:28 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it,
Isaiah 28:29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
Isaiah 29:1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year
Isaiah 29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
Isaiah 29:3 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
Isaiah 29:4 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
Isaiah 29:5 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,
Isaiah 29:6 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
Isaiah 29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
Isaiah 29:8 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he
Isaiah 29:9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
Isaiah 29:10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
Isaiah 29:11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
Isaiah 29:13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
Isaiah 29:15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
Isaiah 29:19 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor
Isaiah 29:20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
Isaiah 29:22 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
Isaiah 29:23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
Isaiah 29:24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and
Isaiah 30:1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
Isaiah 30:4 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
Isaiah 30:5 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor
Isaiah 30:6 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble
Isaiah 30:7 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
Isaiah 30:8 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book,
Isaiah 30:12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise
Isaiah 30:13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
Isaiah 30:14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel
Isaiah 30:15 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
Isaiah 30:16 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
Isaiah 30:17 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
Isaiah 30:18 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
Isaiah 30:19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep
Isaiah 30:20 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
Isaiah 30:22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
Isaiah 30:23 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
Isaiah 30:24 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall

Isaiah 30:26 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
Isaiah 30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
Isaiah 30:29 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
Isaiah 30:30 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
Isaiah 30:31 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
Isaiah 30:32 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
Isaiah 30:33 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;
Isaiah 31:1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses,
Isaiah 31:3 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
Isaiah 31:4 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the
Isaiah 31:5 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
Isaiah 31:6 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
Isaiah 31:7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
Isaiah 31:8 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;
Isaiah 31:9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
Isaiah 32:1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
Isaiah 32:2 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert
Isaiah 32:3 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of
Isaiah 32:4 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
Isaiah 32:5 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
Isaiah 32:6 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work
Isaiah 32:7 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
Isaiah 32:8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
Isaiah 32:9 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
Isaiah 32:10 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for
Isaiah 32:11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
Isaiah 32:12 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
Isaiah 32:13 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea,
Isaiah 32:16 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
Isaiah 32:17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
Isaiah 32:18 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
Isaiah 32:20 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
Isaiah 33:1 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
Isaiah 33:2 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
Isaiah 33:3 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of
Isaiah 33:4 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
Isaiah 33:5 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion
Isaiah 33:6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and
Isaiah 33:7 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of
Isaiah 33:8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken
Isaiah 33:9 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn
Isaiah 33:10 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will
Isaiah 33:11 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
Isaiah 33:12 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
Isaiah 33:13 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
Isaiah 33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
Isaiah 33:17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
Isaiah 33:18 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is
Isaiah 33:20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
Isaiah 33:21 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
Isaiah 33:22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is
Isaiah 33:23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
Isaiah 33:24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
Isaiah 34:1 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the
Isaiah 34:2 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury
Isaiah 34:3 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up
Isaiah 34:4 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
Isaiah 34:5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
Isaiah 34:6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with
Isaiah 34:7 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with
Isaiah 34:8 For it is the day of the LORD’s vengeance, and the year of
Isaiah 34:9 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
Isaiah 34:10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall
Isaiah 34:11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also
Isaiah 34:12 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
Isaiah 34:13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in
Isaiah 34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
Isaiah 34:15 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
Isaiah 34:16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
Isaiah 34:17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it
Isaiah 35:1 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
Isaiah 35:2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
Isaiah 35:3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Isaiah 35:4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
Isaiah 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
Isaiah 35:6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
Isaiah 35:7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land
Isaiah 35:8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called
Isaiah 35:9 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
Isaiah 36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
Isaiah 36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
Isaiah 36:3 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over
Isaiah 36:4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
Isaiah 36:7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
Isaiah 36:8 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
Isaiah 36:9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
Isaiah 36:11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
Isaiah 36:12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to
Isaiah 36:14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
Isaiah 36:15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
Isaiah 36:16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
Isaiah 36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver
Isaiah 36:22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
Isaiah 37:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
Isaiah 37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the
Isaiah 37:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
Isaiah 37:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom
Isaiah 37:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah 37:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
Isaiah 37:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
Isaiah 37:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
Isaiah 37:9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
Isaiah 37:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
Isaiah 37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
Isaiah 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 37:16
Isaiah 37:16 O LORD of
Isaiah 37:17 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
Isaiah 37:18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
Isaiah 37:20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
Isaiah 37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
Isaiah 37:23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
Isaiah 37:24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By
Isaiah 37:25 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
Isaiah 37:26 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient
Isaiah 37:27 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
Isaiah 37:28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
Isaiah 37:29 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
Isaiah 37:30 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
Isaiah 37:31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
Isaiah 37:33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
Isaiah 37:34 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
Isaiah 37:35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
Isaiah 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of
Isaiah 37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
Isaiah 37:38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
Isaiah 38:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
Isaiah 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
Isaiah 38:4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 38:5
Isaiah 38:5 Go, and
Isaiah 38:6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
Isaiah 38:7 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD

Isaiah 38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of
Isaiah 38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s
Isaiah 38:13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
Isaiah 38:14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
Isaiah 38:15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath
Isaiah 38:16 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the
Isaiah 38:17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love
Isaiah 38:18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:
Isaiah 38:19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:
Isaiah 38:20 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
Isaiah 38:21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
Isaiah 38:22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
Isaiah 39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his
Isaiah 39:3 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
Isaiah 39:4 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
Isaiah 39:5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:

Jeremiah 11:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon
Jeremiah 11:12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,
Jeremiah 11:13 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
Jeremiah 11:14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry
Jeremiah 11:15 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath
Jeremiah 11:16 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of

Jeremiah 13:1 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and
Jeremiah 13:2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it
Jeremiah 13:3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
Jeremiah 13:4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and
Jeremiah 13:5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
Jeremiah 13:6 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,
Jeremiah 13:7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
Jeremiah 13:8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:9
Jeremiah 13:9 Thus saith
Jeremiah 13:10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in
Jeremiah 13:11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
Jeremiah 13:12 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
Jeremiah 13:14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
Jeremiah 13:15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.
Jeremiah 13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
Jeremiah 13:17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places
Jeremiah 13:18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:
Jeremiah 13:19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
Jeremiah 13:20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
Jeremiah 13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
Jeremiah 13:24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
Jeremiah 13:25 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the
Jeremiah 13:26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
Jeremiah 13:27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of
Jeremiah 14:2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
Jeremiah 14:3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they
Jeremiah 14:4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,
Jeremiah 14:5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
Jeremiah 14:6 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up
Jeremiah 14:7 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for
Jeremiah 14:8 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why
Jeremiah 14:10 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
Jeremiah 14:11 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their
Jeremiah 14:12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
Jeremiah 14:13 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,
Jeremiah 14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
Jeremiah 14:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
Jeremiah 14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
Jeremiah 14:17 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run
Jeremiah 14:18 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
Jeremiah 14:19 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why
Jeremiah 14:21 Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne
Jeremiah 14:22 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
Jeremiah 15:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before
Jeremiah 15:2 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall

Jeremiah 15:4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
Jeremiah 15:5 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
Jeremiah 15:7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will

Jeremiah 15:11 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily
Jeremiah 15:12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 15:13
Jeremiah 15:13 Thy
Jeremiah 15:14 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
Jeremiah 15:15 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me
Jeremiah 15:16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto
Jeremiah 15:17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
Jeremiah 15:18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth
Jeremiah 15:20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and
Jeremiah 15:21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
Jeremiah 16:1 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 16:2
Jeremiah 16:2 Thou shalt
Jeremiah 16:3 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
Jeremiah 16:5 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
Jeremiah 16:6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall
Jeremiah 16:8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
Jeremiah 16:9 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
Jeremiah 16:10 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all
Jeremiah 16:11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
Jeremiah 16:14 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
Jeremiah 16:16 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
Jeremiah 16:17 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
Jeremiah 16:18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
Jeremiah 16:19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
Jeremiah 16:20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 16:21
Jeremiah 17:1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
Jeremiah 17:3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
Jeremiah 17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
Jeremiah 17:5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
Jeremiah 17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see
Jeremiah 17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the
Jeremiah 17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that

Jeremiah 17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
Jeremiah 17:15 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it
Jeremiah 17:16 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
Jeremiah 17:17 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.
Jeremiah 17:18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
Jeremiah 17:19 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
Jeremiah 17:22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
Jeremiah 17:23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their
Jeremiah 17:24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
Jeremiah 17:25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
Jeremiah 17:26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
Jeremiah 17:27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,

Jeremiah 18:3 Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a
Jeremiah 18:4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
Jeremiah 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18:6
Jeremiah 18:6 O house of
Jeremiah 18:7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
Jeremiah 18:9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
Jeremiah 18:11 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
Jeremiah 18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
Jeremiah 18:13 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who
Jeremiah 18:14 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock
Jeremiah 18:17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
Jeremiah 18:18 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
Jeremiah 18:19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
Jeremiah 18:20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
Jeremiah 18:21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
Jeremiah 18:22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a
Jeremiah 18:23 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:
Jeremiah 19:1 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and
Jeremiah 19:4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and
Jeremiah 19:6 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place
Jeremiah 19:7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this
Jeremiah 19:8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one
Jeremiah 19:9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
Jeremiah 19:10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
Jeremiah 19:12 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
Jeremiah 19:14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
Jeremiah 20:1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
Jeremiah 20:2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
Jeremiah 20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
Jeremiah 20:4 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
Jeremiah 20:5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
Jeremiah 20:6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
Jeremiah 20:7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
Jeremiah 20:8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
Jeremiah 20:9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more
Jeremiah 20:10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
Jeremiah 20:11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
Jeremiah 20:12 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the
Jeremiah 20:13 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
Jeremiah 20:14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my
Jeremiah 20:15 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
Jeremiah 20:16 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and
Jeremiah 20:18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
Jeremiah 21:3 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4
Jeremiah 21:5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
Jeremiah 21:6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
Jeremiah 21:7 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
Jeremiah 21:8 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
Jeremiah 21:9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the
Jeremiah 21:10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for
Jeremiah 21:11 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
Jeremiah 21:13 Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock
Jeremiah 22:1 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
Jeremiah 22:4 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the
Jeremiah 22:5 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the
Jeremiah 22:6 For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou art
Jeremiah 22:7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
Jeremiah 22:8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
Jeremiah 22:10 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
Jeremiah 22:11 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king
Jeremiah 22:13 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
Jeremiah 22:15 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not
Jeremiah 22:17 But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness,
Jeremiah 22:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
Jeremiah 22:20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and
Jeremiah 22:21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not
Jeremiah 22:22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go
Jeremiah 22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
Jeremiah 22:26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
Jeremiah 22:27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall

Jeremiah 22:30 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
Jeremiah 23:1 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
Jeremiah 23:2 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors
Jeremiah 23:3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
Jeremiah 23:4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and
Jeremiah 23:5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
Jeremiah 23:6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
Jeremiah 23:7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall
Jeremiah 23:9 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
Jeremiah 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the
Jeremiah 23:11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I
Jeremiah 23:12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
Jeremiah 23:13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
Jeremiah 23:14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
Jeremiah 23:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
Jeremiah 23:16 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the
Jeremiah 23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
Jeremiah 23:18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
Jeremiah 23:19 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
Jeremiah 23:20 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed,
Jeremiah 23:21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
Jeremiah 23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to
Jeremiah 23:23 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah 23:24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
Jeremiah 23:25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
Jeremiah 23:26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
Jeremiah 23:28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that
Jeremiah 23:29 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer
Jeremiah 23:31 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
Jeremiah 23:32 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the
Jeremiah 23:33 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
Jeremiah 23:34 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
Jeremiah 23:35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to
Jeremiah 23:37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered
Jeremiah 23:40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
Jeremiah 24:1 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set
Jeremiah 24:2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
Jeremiah 24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
Jeremiah 24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5
Jeremiah 24:5 Thus saith
Jeremiah 24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
Jeremiah 24:7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and
Jeremiah 24:8 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
Jeremiah 24:10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among
Jeremiah 25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah
Jeremiah 25:4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
Jeremiah 25:5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
Jeremiah 25:7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might
Jeremiah 25:8 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard
Jeremiah 25:10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice
Jeremiah 25:11 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
Jeremiah 25:12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,
Jeremiah 25:13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
Jeremiah 25:14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
Jeremiah 25:15 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup
Jeremiah 25:16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the
Jeremiah 25:17 Then took I the cup at the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations
Jeremiah 25:25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
Jeremiah 25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
Jeremiah 25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
Jeremiah 25:29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
Jeremiah 25:30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say
Jeremiah 25:31 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
Jeremiah 25:32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
Jeremiah 25:33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of
Jeremiah 25:34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,
Jeremiah 25:35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
Jeremiah 25:36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
Jeremiah 25:37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
Jeremiah 25:38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is
Jeremiah 26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
Jeremiah 26:3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,
Jeremiah 26:4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not
Jeremiah 26:7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
Jeremiah 26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
Jeremiah 26:9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
Jeremiah 26:10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up
Jeremiah 26:11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to
Jeremiah 26:12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
Jeremiah 26:13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
Jeremiah 26:14 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good
Jeremiah 26:15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
Jeremiah 26:16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
Jeremiah 26:17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all
Jeremiah 26:19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
Jeremiah 26:20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
Jeremiah 26:21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all
Jeremiah 26:22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the
Jeremiah 26:23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
Jeremiah 26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
Jeremiah 27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
Jeremiah 27:6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
Jeremiah 27:7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son,
Jeremiah 27:8 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will
Jeremiah 27:9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
Jeremiah 27:10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
Jeremiah 27:11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king
Jeremiah 27:12 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
Jeremiah 27:13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
Jeremiah 27:15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
Jeremiah 27:16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus
Jeremiah 27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
Jeremiah 27:19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
Jeremiah 27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
Jeremiah 28:1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign
Jeremiah 28:3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the
Jeremiah 28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
Jeremiah 28:7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,
Jeremiah 28:9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
Jeremiah 28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
Jeremiah 28:11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
Jeremiah 28:12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after
Jeremiah 28:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put
Jeremiah 28:15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
Jeremiah 28:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off
Jeremiah 28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah 29:1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
Jeremiah 29:7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
Jeremiah 29:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your
Jeremiah 29:9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
Jeremiah 29:10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
Jeremiah 29:12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
Jeremiah 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
Jeremiah 29:14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away
Jeremiah 29:15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
Jeremiah 29:18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
Jeremiah 29:20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,
Jeremiah 29:24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
Jeremiah 29:25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
Jeremiah 29:27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
Jeremiah 29:29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
Jeremiah 29:30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 29:31
Jeremiah 29:31 Send
Jeremiah 30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 30:2
Jeremiah 30:2 Thus
Jeremiah 30:3 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again
Jeremiah 30:4 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and
Jeremiah 30:5 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of
Jeremiah 30:6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
Jeremiah 30:8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
Jeremiah 30:10 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
Jeremiah 30:11 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make
Jeremiah 30:12 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound
Jeremiah 30:13 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:
Jeremiah 30:14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
Jeremiah 30:15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
Jeremiah 30:16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
Jeremiah 30:17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy
Jeremiah 30:18 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
Jeremiah 30:19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them
Jeremiah 30:20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
Jeremiah 30:21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
Jeremiah 30:22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Jeremiah 30:23 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
Jeremiah 30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
Jeremiah 31:1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
Jeremiah 31:2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
Jeremiah 31:3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
Jeremiah 31:4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
Jeremiah 31:5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
Jeremiah 31:6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
Jeremiah 31:7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
Jeremiah 31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them
Jeremiah 31:9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
Jeremiah 31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
Jeremiah 31:11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand
Jeremiah 31:12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
Jeremiah 31:13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
Jeremiah 31:14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
Jeremiah 31:15 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
Jeremiah 31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
Jeremiah 31:17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
Jeremiah 31:18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
Jeremiah 31:19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
Jeremiah 31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
Jeremiah 31:21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
Jeremiah 31:22 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
Jeremiah 31:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
Jeremiah 31:24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
Jeremiah 31:25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every
Jeremiah 31:26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
Jeremiah 31:27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house
Jeremiah 31:28 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
Jeremiah 31:29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
Jeremiah 31:30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
Jeremiah 31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
Jeremiah 31:34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
Jeremiah 31:35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
Jeremiah 31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
Jeremiah 31:38 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
Jeremiah 31:39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
Jeremiah 31:40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
Jeremiah 32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
Jeremiah 32:2 For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and
Jeremiah 32:3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
Jeremiah 32:4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
Jeremiah 32:6 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah 32:7 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto
Jeremiah 32:8 So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the
Jeremiah 32:9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in
Jeremiah 32:10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
Jeremiah 32:11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
Jeremiah 32:13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 32:14
Jeremiah 32:14 Thus saith the
Jeremiah 32:15 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and
Jeremiah 32:16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
Jeremiah 32:18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
Jeremiah 32:25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
Jeremiah 32:26 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 32:27
Jeremiah 32:30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
Jeremiah 32:31 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and
Jeremiah 32:33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though
Jeremiah 32:34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by
Jeremiah 32:35 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
Jeremiah 32:36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
Jeremiah 32:41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
Jeremiah 32:42 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
Jeremiah 32:43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
Jeremiah 32:44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
Jeremiah 33:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
Jeremiah 33:4 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses
Jeremiah 33:6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
Jeremiah 33:7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
Jeremiah 33:8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
Jeremiah 33:9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
Jeremiah 33:10 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
Jeremiah 33:11 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
Jeremiah 33:12 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
Jeremiah 33:13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
Jeremiah 33:14 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that
Jeremiah 33:15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
Jeremiah 33:16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
Jeremiah 33:17 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
Jeremiah 33:19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 33:20
Jeremiah 33:20 Thus
Jeremiah 33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
Jeremiah 33:23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 33:24
Jeremiah 33:25 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
Jeremiah 34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
Jeremiah 34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
Jeremiah 34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
Jeremiah 34:8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
Jeremiah 34:10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered
Jeremiah 34:11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
Jeremiah 34:12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
Jeremiah 34:15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
Jeremiah 34:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
Jeremiah 34:18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
Jeremiah 34:21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the
Jeremiah 34:22 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return
Jeremiah 35:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
Jeremiah 35:3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
Jeremiah 35:6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
Jeremiah 35:8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
Jeremiah 35:10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
Jeremiah 35:11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
Jeremiah 35:12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 35:13
Jeremiah 35:13 Thus
Jeremiah 35:14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
Jeremiah 35:15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
Jeremiah 35:16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
Jeremiah 35:18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
Jeremiah 36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Jeremiah 36:3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
Jeremiah 36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
Jeremiah 36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go
Jeremiah 36:7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
Jeremiah 36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
Jeremiah 36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Jeremiah 36:10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
Jeremiah 36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard
Jeremiah 36:13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
Jeremiah 36:14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
Jeremiah 36:15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
Jeremiah 36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
Jeremiah 36:17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write
Jeremiah 36:19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
Jeremiah 36:20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
Jeremiah 36:21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
Jeremiah 36:22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
Jeremiah 36:23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
Jeremiah 36:24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
Jeremiah 36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
Jeremiah 36:26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
Jeremiah 36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king
Jeremiah 36:29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
Jeremiah 36:31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
Jeremiah 36:32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
Jeremiah 37:1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the
Jeremiah 37:2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did
Jeremiah 37:3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
Jeremiah 37:4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had
Jeremiah 37:5 Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
Jeremiah 37:6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,
Jeremiah 37:7 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the
Jeremiah 37:8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city,
Jeremiah 37:9 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
Jeremiah 37:10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
Jeremiah 37:11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
Jeremiah 37:13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
Jeremiah 37:14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
Jeremiah 37:15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
Jeremiah 37:16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
Jeremiah 37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
Jeremiah 37:21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
Jeremiah 38:1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
Jeremiah 38:3 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
Jeremiah 38:4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
Jeremiah 38:5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the
Jeremiah 38:6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
Jeremiah 38:7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was
Jeremiah 38:10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
Jeremiah 38:11 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of
Jeremiah 38:12 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
Jeremiah 38:13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
Jeremiah 38:14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
Jeremiah 38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
Jeremiah 38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
Jeremiah 38:18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
Jeremiah 38:19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
Jeremiah 38:20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
Jeremiah 38:21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
Jeremiah 38:23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
Jeremiah 38:24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
Jeremiah 38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
Jeremiah 38:27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
Jeremiah 38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
Jeremiah 39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,
Jeremiah 39:2 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
Jeremiah 39:3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
Jeremiah 39:4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
Jeremiah 39:5 But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah
Jeremiah 39:6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
Jeremiah 39:7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains,
Jeremiah 39:8 And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the
Jeremiah 39:9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
Jeremiah 39:10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
Jeremiah 39:11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
Jeremiah 39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
Jeremiah 39:15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
Jeremiah 39:17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
Jeremiah 39:18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
Jeremiah 40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
Jeremiah 40:2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
Jeremiah 40:3 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:
Jeremiah 40:4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were
Jeremiah 40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
Jeremiah 40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
Jeremiah 40:7 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,
Jeremiah 40:9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them
Jeremiah 40:10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
Jeremiah 40:11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
Jeremiah 40:13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
Jeremiah 40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
Jeremiah 41:1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
Jeremiah 41:2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
Jeremiah 41:3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
Jeremiah 41:4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,
Jeremiah 41:6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet
Jeremiah 41:7 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
Jeremiah 41:8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us
Jeremiah 41:9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
Jeremiah 41:10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
Jeremiah 41:11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
Jeremiah 41:13 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
Jeremiah 41:14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
Jeremiah 41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
Jeremiah 41:16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
Jeremiah 42:1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
Jeremiah 42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
Jeremiah 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
Jeremiah 42:6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
Jeremiah 42:7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
Jeremiah 42:8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
Jeremiah 42:11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be
Jeremiah 42:12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
Jeremiah 42:13 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the
Jeremiah 42:17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into
Jeremiah 42:18 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
Jeremiah 42:19 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye
Jeremiah 42:20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD
Jeremiah 42:21 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
Jeremiah 42:22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by
Jeremiah 43:1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
Jeremiah 43:2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
Jeremiah 43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
Jeremiah 43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
Jeremiah 43:6 Even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and
Jeremiah 43:7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
Jeremiah 43:8 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
Jeremiah 43:11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
Jeremiah 43:12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and
Jeremiah 43:13 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
Jeremiah 44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
Jeremiah 44:3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke
Jeremiah 44:4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
Jeremiah 44:5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
Jeremiah 44:6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
Jeremiah 44:7 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of
Jeremiah 44:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Jeremiah 44:12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces
Jeremiah 44:13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
Jeremiah 44:15 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
Jeremiah 44:17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
Jeremiah 44:18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
Jeremiah 44:19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
Jeremiah 44:23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
Jeremiah 44:24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
Jeremiah 44:26 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in
Jeremiah 44:27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
Jeremiah 44:28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
Jeremiah 44:29 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
Jeremiah 45:1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of
Jeremiah 45:4 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that
Jeremiah 45:5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
Jeremiah 46:1 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against
Jeremiah 46:3 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
Jeremiah 46:4 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with
Jeremiah 46:5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
Jeremiah 46:6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
Jeremiah 46:7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as
Jeremiah 46:9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men
Jeremiah 46:10 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
Jeremiah 46:11 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
Jeremiah 46:12 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the
Jeremiah 46:13 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
Jeremiah 46:14 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph
Jeremiah 46:15 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the
Jeremiah 46:16 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said,
Jeremiah 46:17 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
Jeremiah 46:18 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
Jeremiah 46:19 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
Jeremiah 46:20 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
Jeremiah 46:21 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks;
Jeremiah 46:22 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march
Jeremiah 46:23 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot
Jeremiah 46:24 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
Jeremiah 46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
Jeremiah 46:27 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
Jeremiah 46:28 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with
Jeremiah 47:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
Jeremiah 47:2 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and
Jeremiah 47:3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,
Jeremiah 47:4 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and
Jeremiah 47:5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
Jeremiah 47:7 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
Jeremiah 48:1 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe
Jeremiah 48:2 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
Jeremiah 48:3 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
Jeremiah 48:4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
Jeremiah 48:5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for
Jeremiah 48:6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
Jeremiah 48:7 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,
Jeremiah 48:8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
Jeremiah 48:9 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
Jeremiah 48:10 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
Jeremiah 48:11 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
Jeremiah 48:12 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
Jeremiah 48:13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
Jeremiah 48:14 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? 48:15
Jeremiah 48:16 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
Jeremiah 48:17 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his
Jeremiah 48:18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory,
Jeremiah 48:19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that
Jeremiah 48:25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the
Jeremiah 48:26 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD:
Jeremiah 48:27 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
Jeremiah 48:28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
Jeremiah 48:29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
Jeremiah 48:30 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his
Jeremiah 48:31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
Jeremiah 48:32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
Jeremiah 48:33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from
Jeremiah 48:34 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,
Jeremiah 48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that
Jeremiah 48:36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
Jeremiah 48:37 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all
Jeremiah 48:38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
Jeremiah 48:39 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
Jeremiah 48:40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
Jeremiah 48:41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
Jeremiah 48:42 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
Jeremiah 48:43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
Jeremiah 48:44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
Jeremiah 48:45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the
Jeremiah 48:46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for
Jeremiah 48:47 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
Jeremiah 49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
Jeremiah 49:3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
Jeremiah 49:4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
Jeremiah 49:6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of
Jeremiah 49:7 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more
Jeremiah 49:9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
Jeremiah 49:10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
Jeremiah 49:11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
Jeremiah 49:12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to
Jeremiah 49:13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
Jeremiah 49:14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
Jeremiah 49:15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
Jeremiah 49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
Jeremiah 49:17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
Jeremiah 49:18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
Jeremiah 49:19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
Jeremiah 49:21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
Jeremiah 49:22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
Jeremiah 49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
Jeremiah 49:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear
Jeremiah 49:25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 49:26
Jeremiah 49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
Jeremiah 49:28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
Jeremiah 49:29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
Jeremiah 49:30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
Jeremiah 49:31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without
Jeremiah 49:32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
Jeremiah 49:33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
Jeremiah 49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
Jeremiah 49:35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
Jeremiah 49:36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters
Jeremiah 49:37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
Jeremiah 49:39 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring
Jeremiah 50:1 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land
Jeremiah 50:2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
Jeremiah 50:3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which
Jeremiah 50:4 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of
Jeremiah 50:5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
Jeremiah 50:6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them
Jeremiah 50:7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
Jeremiah 50:8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
Jeremiah 50:9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
Jeremiah 50:10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
Jeremiah 50:11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
Jeremiah 50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but
Jeremiah 50:14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that
Jeremiah 50:15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
Jeremiah 50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle
Jeremiah 50:17 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
Jeremiah 50:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Jeremiah 50:19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall

Lamentations 3:1 I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
Lamentations 3:2 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
Lamentations 3:3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all

Ezekiel 7:7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
Ezekiel 7:8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
Ezekiel 7:9 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
Ezekiel 7:10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
Ezekiel 7:11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
Ezekiel 7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
Ezekiel 7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
Ezekiel 7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
Ezekiel 7:15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:
Ezekiel 7:16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
Ezekiel 7:17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel 7:18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
Ezekiel 7:19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall
Ezekiel 7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
Ezekiel 7:21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
Ezekiel 7:22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
Ezekiel 7:23 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city
Ezekiel 7:24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall
Ezekiel 7:25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be
Ezekiel 7:26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
Ezekiel 7:27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
Ezekiel 8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
Ezekiel 8:2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from
Ezekiel 8:3 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
Ezekiel 8:4 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according
Ezekiel 8:5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way
Ezekiel 8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?
Ezekiel 8:7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
Ezekiel 8:8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I
Ezekiel 8:9 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
Ezekiel 8:10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,
Ezekiel 8:11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
Ezekiel 8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
Ezekiel 8:13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
Ezekiel 8:14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house
Ezekiel 8:15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
Ezekiel 8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house, and,
Ezekiel 8:17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a
Ezekiel 8:18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
Ezekiel 9:1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them
Ezekiel 9:2 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which
Ezekiel 9:3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
Ezekiel 9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
Ezekiel 9:5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through
Ezekiel 9:7 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with
Ezekiel 9:8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
Ezekiel 9:10 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
Ezekiel 9:11 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by
Ezekiel 10:1 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the
Ezekiel 10:2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
Ezekiel 10:3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the
Ezekiel 10:4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
Ezekiel 10:5 And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the outer
Ezekiel 10:6 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed
Ezekiel 10:7 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
Ezekiel 10:8 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand
Ezekiel 10:9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one
Ezekiel 10:10 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if
Ezekiel 10:11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not
Ezekiel 10:12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
Ezekiel 10:13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
Ezekiel 10:14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
Ezekiel 10:15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
Ezekiel 10:16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
Ezekiel 10:17 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
Ezekiel 10:18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
Ezekiel 10:19 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
Ezekiel 10:20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
Ezekiel 10:21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
Ezekiel 10:22 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
Ezekiel 11:1 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
Ezekiel 11:2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise
Ezekiel 11:4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
Ezekiel 11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
Ezekiel 11:6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
Ezekiel 11:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid
Ezekiel 11:8 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
Ezekiel 11:9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
Ezekiel 11:10 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
Ezekiel 11:11 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
Ezekiel 11:13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
Ezekiel 11:15 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
Ezekiel 11:16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
Ezekiel 11:17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
Ezekiel 11:18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
Ezekiel 11:19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
Ezekiel 11:21 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
Ezekiel 11:22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
Ezekiel 11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
Ezekiel 11:24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by
Ezekiel 11:25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the
Ezekiel 12:1 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 12:2
Ezekiel 12:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 12:3 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
Ezekiel 12:4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as
Ezekiel 12:5 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
Ezekiel 12:6 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry
Ezekiel 12:7 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day,
Ezekiel 12:8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
Ezekiel 12:9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
Ezekiel 12:11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
Ezekiel 12:12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
Ezekiel 12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
Ezekiel 12:14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
Ezekiel 12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
Ezekiel 12:16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
Ezekiel 12:17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12:18
Ezekiel 12:18 Son of
Ezekiel 12:20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
Ezekiel 12:21 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 12:22
Ezekiel 12:22 Son of man,
Ezekiel 12:24 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
Ezekiel 12:25 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak
Ezekiel 12:26 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
Ezekiel 12:27 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
Ezekiel 12:28 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
Ezekiel 13:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:2
Ezekiel 13:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 13:5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for
Ezekiel 13:6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
Ezekiel 13:7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
Ezekiel 13:9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
Ezekiel 13:10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
Ezekiel 13:12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
Ezekiel 13:14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
Ezekiel 13:15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
Ezekiel 13:17 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of
Ezekiel 13:21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
Ezekiel 13:22 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
Ezekiel 13:23 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
Ezekiel 14:1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before
Ezekiel 14:2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 14:3
Ezekiel 14:3 Son of man,
Ezekiel 14:5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because
Ezekiel 14:6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Ezekiel 14:7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
Ezekiel 14:9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
Ezekiel 14:10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
Ezekiel 14:12 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 14:13
Ezekiel 14:13 Son of man,
Ezekiel 14:15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
Ezekiel 14:17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through
Ezekiel 14:19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
Ezekiel 14:21 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
Ezekiel 14:22 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
Ezekiel 14:23 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
Ezekiel 15:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 15:2
Ezekiel 15:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 15:4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
Ezekiel 15:7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
Ezekiel 15:8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a
Ezekiel 16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 16:2
Ezekiel 16:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 16:4 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was
Ezekiel 16:5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
Ezekiel 16:6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
Ezekiel 16:7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
Ezekiel 16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time
Ezekiel 16:9 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy
Ezekiel 16:10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
Ezekiel 16:11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
Ezekiel 16:12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
Ezekiel 16:13 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was
Ezekiel 16:14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for
Ezekiel 16:15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
Ezekiel 16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
Ezekiel 16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
Ezekiel 16:19 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
Ezekiel 16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
Ezekiel 16:23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
Ezekiel 16:25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
Ezekiel 16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
Ezekiel 16:27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
Ezekiel 16:28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
Ezekiel 16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
Ezekiel 16:30 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
Ezekiel 16:33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all
Ezekiel 16:34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
Ezekiel 16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36
Ezekiel 16:36 Thus saith
Ezekiel 16:38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
Ezekiel 16:39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw
Ezekiel 16:40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
Ezekiel 16:41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
Ezekiel 16:42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
Ezekiel 16:43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
Ezekiel 16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
Ezekiel 16:45 Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
Ezekiel 16:46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
Ezekiel 16:47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
Ezekiel 16:48 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
Ezekiel 16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
Ezekiel 16:50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
Ezekiel 16:51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
Ezekiel 16:52 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
Ezekiel 16:53 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom
Ezekiel 16:55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
Ezekiel 16:56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
Ezekiel 16:58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
Ezekiel 16:59 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
Ezekiel 16:60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
Ezekiel 16:61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
Ezekiel 16:62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
Ezekiel 17:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:2
Ezekiel 17:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 17:5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
Ezekiel 17:6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
Ezekiel 17:7 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
Ezekiel 17:8 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
Ezekiel 17:9 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not
Ezekiel 17:10 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
Ezekiel 17:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:12
Ezekiel 17:12 Say
Ezekiel 17:15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
Ezekiel 17:17 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
Ezekiel 17:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
Ezekiel 17:20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
Ezekiel 17:21 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
Ezekiel 17:22 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch
Ezekiel 17:24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
Ezekiel 18:1 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 18:2
Ezekiel 18:2 What mean
Ezekiel 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
Ezekiel 18:5 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 18:6
Ezekiel 18:10 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
Ezekiel 18:14 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins
Ezekiel 18:18 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
Ezekiel 18:19 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
Ezekiel 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
Ezekiel 18:21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
Ezekiel 18:22 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
Ezekiel 18:23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
Ezekiel 18:24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
Ezekiel 18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house
Ezekiel 18:27 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that
Ezekiel 18:28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
Ezekiel 18:29 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal.
Ezekiel 18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
Ezekiel 18:31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
Ezekiel 19:1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
Ezekiel 19:2 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,
Ezekiel 19:3 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and
Ezekiel 19:4 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
Ezekiel 19:5 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then
Ezekiel 19:6 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion,
Ezekiel 19:7 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
Ezekiel 19:8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the
Ezekiel 19:9 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king
Ezekiel 19:10 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
Ezekiel 19:11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
Ezekiel 19:12 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
Ezekiel 19:13 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
Ezekiel 19:14 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
Ezekiel 20:1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
Ezekiel 20:2 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 20:3
Ezekiel 20:3 Son of man,
Ezekiel 20:4 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
Ezekiel 20:8 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they
Ezekiel 20:9 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
Ezekiel 20:10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
Ezekiel 20:11 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
Ezekiel 20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
Ezekiel 20:13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
Ezekiel 20:14 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
Ezekiel 20:15 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
Ezekiel 20:17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither
Ezekiel 20:18 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in
Ezekiel 20:21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
Ezekiel 20:22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s
Ezekiel 20:23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
Ezekiel 20:25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
Ezekiel 20:27 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
Ezekiel 20:28 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
Ezekiel 20:29 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
Ezekiel 20:30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Ezekiel 20:32 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
Ezekiel 20:33 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
Ezekiel 20:35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
Ezekiel 20:36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
Ezekiel 20:37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
Ezekiel 20:39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
Ezekiel 20:40 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
Ezekiel 20:41 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
Ezekiel 20:42 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
Ezekiel 20:43 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
Ezekiel 20:44 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
Ezekiel 20:45 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 20:46
Ezekiel 20:46 Son of
Ezekiel 20:48 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
Ezekiel 20:49 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
Ezekiel 21:4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the
Ezekiel 21:6 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;
Ezekiel 21:7 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
Ezekiel 21:8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:9
Ezekiel 21:9 Son of man,
Ezekiel 21:11 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
Ezekiel 21:12 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
Ezekiel 21:13 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
Ezekiel 21:14 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
Ezekiel 21:15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that
Ezekiel 21:16 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
Ezekiel 21:17 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury
Ezekiel 21:18 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 21:19
Ezekiel 21:19 Also,
Ezekiel 21:20 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
Ezekiel 21:21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the
Ezekiel 21:22 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
Ezekiel 21:23 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,
Ezekiel 21:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
Ezekiel 21:25 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
Ezekiel 21:27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
Ezekiel 21:28 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD
Ezekiel 21:30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in
Ezekiel 21:31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
Ezekiel 21:32 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
Ezekiel 22:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:2
Ezekiel 22:2 Now,
Ezekiel 22:3 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
Ezekiel 22:4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast
Ezekiel 22:5 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock
Ezekiel 22:6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
Ezekiel 22:7 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of
Ezekiel 22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
Ezekiel 22:9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they
Ezekiel 22:10 In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee
Ezekiel 22:11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife;
Ezekiel 22:12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
Ezekiel 22:13 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
Ezekiel 22:14 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
Ezekiel 22:15 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in
Ezekiel 22:16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of
Ezekiel 22:17 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:18
Ezekiel 22:18 Son of man,
Ezekiel 22:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
Ezekiel 22:20 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
Ezekiel 22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
Ezekiel 22:22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be
Ezekiel 22:23 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:24
Ezekiel 22:24 Son of man,
Ezekiel 22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like
Ezekiel 22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
Ezekiel 22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
Ezekiel 22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing
Ezekiel 22:29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
Ezekiel 22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
Ezekiel 22:31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
Ezekiel 23:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 23:2
Ezekiel 23:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 23:4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
Ezekiel 23:5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on
Ezekiel 23:7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
Ezekiel 23:8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
Ezekiel 23:9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into
Ezekiel 23:10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
Ezekiel 23:11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
Ezekiel 23:12 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
Ezekiel 23:13 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
Ezekiel 23:14 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
Ezekiel 23:16 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,
Ezekiel 23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
Ezekiel 23:18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
Ezekiel 23:19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the
Ezekiel 23:20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
Ezekiel 23:21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
Ezekiel 23:22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
Ezekiel 23:24 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
Ezekiel 23:25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
Ezekiel 23:26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy
Ezekiel 23:27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
Ezekiel 23:28 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
Ezekiel 23:30 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
Ezekiel 23:31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give
Ezekiel 23:32 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup
Ezekiel 23:33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
Ezekiel 23:34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
Ezekiel 23:35 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
Ezekiel 23:36 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
Ezekiel 23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
Ezekiel 23:39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
Ezekiel 23:40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
Ezekiel 23:42 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with
Ezekiel 23:43 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
Ezekiel 23:45 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of
Ezekiel 23:46 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
Ezekiel 23:47 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them
Ezekiel 23:48 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
Ezekiel 23:49 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
Ezekiel 24:1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
Ezekiel 24:3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,
Ezekiel 24:5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,
Ezekiel 24:6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the
Ezekiel 24:7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of
Ezekiel 24:9 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will
Ezekiel 24:10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
Ezekiel 24:11 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
Ezekiel 24:12 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not
Ezekiel 24:13 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
Ezekiel 24:14 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do
Ezekiel 24:15 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:16
Ezekiel 24:16 Son of
Ezekiel 24:17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of
Ezekiel 24:18 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
Ezekiel 24:19 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
Ezekiel 24:22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
Ezekiel 24:23 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
Ezekiel 24:24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
Ezekiel 24:25 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
Ezekiel 25:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 25:2
Ezekiel 25:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 25:5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
Ezekiel 25:6 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
Ezekiel 25:8 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
Ezekiel 25:11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that
Ezekiel 25:12 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
Ezekiel 25:14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
Ezekiel 25:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
Ezekiel 25:17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
Ezekiel 26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the
Ezekiel 26:4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
Ezekiel 26:5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
Ezekiel 26:6 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
Ezekiel 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
Ezekiel 26:8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he
Ezekiel 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his
Ezekiel 26:10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
Ezekiel 26:11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
Ezekiel 26:12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
Ezekiel 26:13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound
Ezekiel 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
Ezekiel 26:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
Ezekiel 26:17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,
Ezekiel 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
Ezekiel 27:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2
Ezekiel 27:2 Now, thou
Ezekiel 27:4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
Ezekiel 27:5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
Ezekiel 27:6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of
Ezekiel 27:7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
Ezekiel 27:8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
Ezekiel 27:9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy
Ezekiel 27:10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
Ezekiel 27:11 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
Ezekiel 27:12 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind
Ezekiel 27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded
Ezekiel 27:14 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
Ezekiel 27:15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
Ezekiel 27:16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
Ezekiel 27:17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
Ezekiel 27:18 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
Ezekiel 27:19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
Ezekiel 27:20 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
Ezekiel 27:21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in
Ezekiel 27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they
Ezekiel 27:23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and
Ezekiel 27:24 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
Ezekiel 27:25 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
Ezekiel 27:26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
Ezekiel 27:27 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
Ezekiel 27:28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
Ezekiel 27:29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of
Ezekiel 27:32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee,
Ezekiel 27:34 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
Ezekiel 27:35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
Ezekiel 27:36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be
Ezekiel 28:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 28:2
Ezekiel 28:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 28:4 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
Ezekiel 28:8 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
Ezekiel 28:9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
Ezekiel 28:10 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
Ezekiel 28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12
Ezekiel 28:12 Son of
Ezekiel 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
Ezekiel 28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
Ezekiel 28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
Ezekiel 28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
Ezekiel 28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
Ezekiel 28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
Ezekiel 28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
Ezekiel 28:20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:21
Ezekiel 28:21 Son of
Ezekiel 28:23 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;
Ezekiel 28:24 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
Ezekiel 28:25 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of
Ezekiel 28:26 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and
Ezekiel 29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
Ezekiel 29:4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
Ezekiel 29:5 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
Ezekiel 29:6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,
Ezekiel 29:7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
Ezekiel 29:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword
Ezekiel 29:9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall
Ezekiel 29:10 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and
Ezekiel 29:11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
Ezekiel 29:12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
Ezekiel 29:13 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
Ezekiel 29:14 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
Ezekiel 29:15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
Ezekiel 29:16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
Ezekiel 29:17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
Ezekiel 29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
Ezekiel 29:21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud
Ezekiel 30:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 30:2
Ezekiel 30:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 30:3 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy
Ezekiel 30:4 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in
Ezekiel 30:5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and
Ezekiel 30:6 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and
Ezekiel 30:7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are
Ezekiel 30:8 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
Ezekiel 30:9 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
Ezekiel 30:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt
Ezekiel 30:11 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
Ezekiel 30:12 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
Ezekiel 30:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
Ezekiel 30:14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
Ezekiel 30:15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
Ezekiel 30:16 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No
Ezekiel 30:17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
Ezekiel 30:18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
Ezekiel 30:19 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that
Ezekiel 30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in
Ezekiel 30:22 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh
Ezekiel 30:23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
Ezekiel 30:24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
Ezekiel 30:25 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
Ezekiel 30:26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse
Ezekiel 31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
Ezekiel 31:4 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
Ezekiel 31:5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
Ezekiel 31:6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under
Ezekiel 31:7 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:
Ezekiel 31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
Ezekiel 31:9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
Ezekiel 31:10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
Ezekiel 31:12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
Ezekiel 31:13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all
Ezekiel 31:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
Ezekiel 31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
Ezekiel 31:17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
Ezekiel 31:18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
Ezekiel 32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in
Ezekiel 32:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over
Ezekiel 32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon
Ezekiel 32:5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
Ezekiel 32:6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
Ezekiel 32:7 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make
Ezekiel 32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and
Ezekiel 32:9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy
Ezekiel 32:10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
Ezekiel 32:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
Ezekiel 32:12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,
Ezekiel 32:13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
Ezekiel 32:14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
Ezekiel 32:15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
Ezekiel 32:16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
Ezekiel 32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
Ezekiel 32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
Ezekiel 32:20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
Ezekiel 32:21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
Ezekiel 32:22 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
Ezekiel 32:24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
Ezekiel 32:25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
Ezekiel 32:26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
Ezekiel 32:27 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
Ezekiel 32:28 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and
Ezekiel 32:29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their
Ezekiel 32:30 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
Ezekiel 32:31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
Ezekiel 32:32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
Ezekiel 33:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:2
Ezekiel 33:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 33:4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
Ezekiel 33:5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
Ezekiel 33:6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
Ezekiel 33:7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house
Ezekiel 33:8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
Ezekiel 33:9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
Ezekiel 33:10 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
Ezekiel 33:13 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if
Ezekiel 33:14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he
Ezekiel 33:16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto
Ezekiel 33:17 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
Ezekiel 33:18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
Ezekiel 33:19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is
Ezekiel 33:20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
Ezekiel 33:21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
Ezekiel 33:22 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
Ezekiel 33:23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:24
Ezekiel 33:24 Son of
Ezekiel 33:25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
Ezekiel 33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
Ezekiel 33:29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
Ezekiel 33:30 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
Ezekiel 33:31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
Ezekiel 33:32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
Ezekiel 33:33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
Ezekiel 34:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2
Ezekiel 34:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 34:4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
Ezekiel 34:5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they
Ezekiel 34:6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high
Ezekiel 34:7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8
Ezekiel 34:8 As I
Ezekiel 34:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search
Ezekiel 34:12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among
Ezekiel 34:13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from
Ezekiel 34:14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
Ezekiel 34:15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
Ezekiel 34:16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was
Ezekiel 34:17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
Ezekiel 34:18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
Ezekiel 34:20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I,
Ezekiel 34:21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
Ezekiel 34:22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
Ezekiel 34:23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
Ezekiel 34:24 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince
Ezekiel 34:25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
Ezekiel 34:26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
Ezekiel 34:27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
Ezekiel 34:28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
Ezekiel 34:29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
Ezekiel 34:30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and
Ezekiel 34:31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
Ezekiel 35:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 35:2
Ezekiel 35:2 Son of
Ezekiel 35:4 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou
Ezekiel 35:5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood
Ezekiel 35:7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
Ezekiel 35:8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,
Ezekiel 35:9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not
Ezekiel 35:10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
Ezekiel 35:12 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
Ezekiel 35:13 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
Ezekiel 35:14 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will
Ezekiel 35:15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
Ezekiel 36:1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and
Ezekiel 36:6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
Ezekiel 36:8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
Ezekiel 36:9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall
Ezekiel 36:12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
Ezekiel 36:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
Ezekiel 36:15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
Ezekiel 36:16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 36:17
Ezekiel 36:17 Son of
Ezekiel 36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
Ezekiel 36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
Ezekiel 36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
Ezekiel 36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;
Ezekiel 36:23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
Ezekiel 36:24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
Ezekiel 36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
Ezekiel 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
Ezekiel 36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
Ezekiel 36:28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and
Ezekiel 36:29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
Ezekiel 36:30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
Ezekiel 36:31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
Ezekiel 36:32 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
Ezekiel 36:33 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
Ezekiel 36:34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
Ezekiel 36:35 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
Ezekiel 36:36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I
Ezekiel 36:37 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
Ezekiel 36:38 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
Ezekiel 37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
Ezekiel 37:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
Ezekiel 37:4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
Ezekiel 37:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
Ezekiel 37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
Ezekiel 37:8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
Ezekiel 37:9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
Ezekiel 37:10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
Ezekiel 37:11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
Ezekiel 37:12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Ezekiel 37:13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
Ezekiel 37:15 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 37:16
Ezekiel 37:16 Moreover,
Ezekiel 37:18 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
Ezekiel 37:20 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
Ezekiel 37:21 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
Ezekiel 37:23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
Ezekiel 37:24 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall
Ezekiel 37:25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my
Ezekiel 37:26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be
Ezekiel 37:27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God,
Ezekiel 37:28 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
Ezekiel 38:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 38:2
Ezekiel 38:2 Son of man,
Ezekiel 38:7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
Ezekiel 38:8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou
Ezekiel 38:9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
Ezekiel 38:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the
Ezekiel 38:13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
Ezekiel 38:14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the
Ezekiel 38:17 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
Ezekiel 38:19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
Ezekiel 38:21 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
Ezekiel 38:22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and
Ezekiel 38:23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
Ezekiel 39:1 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
Ezekiel 39:4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
Ezekiel 39:5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith
Ezekiel 39:6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
Ezekiel 39:7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
Ezekiel 39:8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is
Ezekiel 39:9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and
Ezekiel 39:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog
Ezekiel 39:12 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
Ezekiel 39:13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be
Ezekiel 39:14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
Ezekiel 39:15 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a
Ezekiel 39:16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they
Ezekiel 39:17 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every
Ezekiel 39:18 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the
Ezekiel 39:19 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be
Ezekiel 39:20 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
Ezekiel 39:21 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
Ezekiel 39:22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
Ezekiel 39:23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
Ezekiel 39:24 According to their uncleanness and according to their
Ezekiel 39:25 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
Ezekiel 39:27 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered

Ezekiel 40:1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
Ezekiel 40:2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and

Ezekiel 40:7 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;
Ezekiel 40:8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
Ezekiel 40:9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
Ezekiel 40:10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this
Ezekiel 40:11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
Ezekiel 40:12 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this
Ezekiel 40:13 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to
Ezekiel 40:14 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
Ezekiel 40:15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
Ezekiel 40:16 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
Ezekiel 40:17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
Ezekiel 40:18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
Ezekiel 40:19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower

Ezekiel 40:25 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
Ezekiel 40:26 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
Ezekiel 40:27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
Ezekiel 40:28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he

Ezekiel 40:42 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
Ezekiel 40:43 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and
Ezekiel 40:44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in

Ezekiel 41:6 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
Ezekiel 41:7 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to
Ezekiel 41:8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
Ezekiel 41:9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
Ezekiel 41:10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
Ezekiel 41:11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that

Ezekiel 41:24 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
Ezekiel 41:25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
Ezekiel 41:26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and
Ezekiel 42:1 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the
Ezekiel 42:2 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
Ezekiel 42:3 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
Ezekiel 42:4 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward,
Ezekiel 42:5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
Ezekiel 42:6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
Ezekiel 42:7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward
Ezekiel 42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
Ezekiel 42:9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as
Ezekiel 42:10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
Ezekiel 42:11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
Ezekiel 42:12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
Ezekiel 42:13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
Ezekiel 42:14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of

Ezekiel 43:3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
Ezekiel 43:4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the
Ezekiel 43:5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
Ezekiel 43:6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
Ezekiel 43:7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
Ezekiel 43:8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their
Ezekiel 43:9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their

Ezekiel 43:16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
Ezekiel 43:17 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad

Ezekiel 44:4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
Ezekiel 44:5 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with
Ezekiel 44:6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
Ezekiel 44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have
Ezekiel 44:9 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
Ezekiel 44:10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went
Ezekiel 44:11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
Ezekiel 44:12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused
Ezekiel 44:13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a

Ezekiel 44:25 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but
Ezekiel 44:26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
Ezekiel 44:27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner

Ezekiel 45:1 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
Ezekiel 45:2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length,
Ezekiel 45:3 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
Ezekiel 45:4 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the

Daniel 1:5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat,
Daniel 1:6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
Daniel 1:8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
Daniel 1:9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the
Daniel 1:10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
Daniel 1:11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
Daniel 1:13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
Daniel 1:14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
Daniel 1:15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
Daniel 1:16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
Daniel 1:17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in
Daniel 1:18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring

Daniel 2:1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
Daniel 2:2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
Daniel 2:3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
Daniel 2:4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for
Daniel 2:5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
Daniel 2:6 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
Daniel 2:7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the
Daniel 2:8 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain
Daniel 2:9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
Daniel 2:10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a
Daniel 2:11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none
Daniel 2:12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
Daniel 2:13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and
Daniel 2:14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the

Daniel 2:17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
Daniel 2:19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then
Daniel 2:20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and
Daniel 2:23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
Daniel 2:24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
Daniel 2:25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
Daniel 2:26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
Daniel 2:30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
Daniel 2:31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
Daniel 2:32 This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
Daniel 2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
Daniel 2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
Daniel 2:36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
Daniel 2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
Daniel 2:38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
Daniel 2:39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
Daniel 2:40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
Daniel 2:41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay,
Daniel 2:42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
Daniel 2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall

Daniel 3:11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
Daniel 3:12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
Daniel 3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
Daniel 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
Daniel 3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
Daniel 3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
Daniel 3:19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage
Daniel 3:20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
Daniel 3:21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
Daniel 3:22 Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the
Daniel 3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down
Daniel 3:24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,
Daniel 3:25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
Daniel 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
Daniel 3:27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s
Daniel 3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
Daniel 3:29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
Daniel 3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
Daniel 4:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
Daniel 4:2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God
Daniel 4:3 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his

Daniel 4:6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
Daniel 4:7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
Daniel 4:8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
Daniel 4:10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a
Daniel 4:11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
Daniel 4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
Daniel 4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by
Daniel 4:18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
Daniel 4:19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
Daniel 4:20 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose

Daniel 4:26 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;
Daniel 4:27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
Daniel 4:28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel 4:29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
Daniel 4:30 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have

Daniel 4:37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
Daniel 5:1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
Daniel 5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the

Daniel 5:4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
Daniel 5:5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote
Daniel 5:6 Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
Daniel 5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
Daniel 5:8 Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the
Daniel 5:9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
Daniel 5:10 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
Daniel 5:13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
Daniel 5:15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
Daniel 5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be
Daniel 5:18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
Daniel 5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
Daniel 5:22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
Daniel 5:25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
Daniel 5:26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered
Daniel 5:27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
Daniel 5:28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Daniel 5:29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
Daniel 5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
Daniel 5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
Daniel 6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
Daniel 6:3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
Daniel 6:4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
Daniel 6:5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this
Daniel 6:6 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,
Daniel 6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
Daniel 6:8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it
Daniel 6:9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
Daniel 6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
Daniel 6:11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
Daniel 6:12 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
Daniel 6:13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which
Daniel 6:14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
Daniel 6:15 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,
Daniel 6:16 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
Daniel 6:17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and
Daniel 6:18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
Daniel 6:19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
Daniel 6:20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
Daniel 6:22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that
Daniel 6:23 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
Daniel 6:24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
Daniel 6:25 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
Daniel 6:26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
Daniel 6:27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in
Daniel 6:28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign
Daniel 7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
Daniel 7:2 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
Daniel 7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
Daniel 7:4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till
Daniel 7:5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
Daniel 7:6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
Daniel 7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
Daniel 7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
Daniel 7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
Daniel 7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
Daniel 7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
Daniel 7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man
Daniel 7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that
Daniel 7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
Daniel 7:16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
Daniel 7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall
Daniel 7:18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
Daniel 7:19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
Daniel 7:21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
Daniel 7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
Daniel 7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
Daniel 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall
Daniel 7:26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
Daniel 7:27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
Daniel 7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
Daniel 8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
Daniel 8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
Daniel 8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
Daniel 8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
Daniel 8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on
Daniel 8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
Daniel 8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
Daniel 8:8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
Daniel 8:9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
Daniel 8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
Daniel 8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by
Daniel 8:12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
Daniel 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
Daniel 8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
Daniel 8:16 And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which
Daniel 8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
Daniel 8:18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
Daniel 8:19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the
Daniel 8:20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
Daniel 8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
Daniel 8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
Daniel 8:23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
Daniel 8:24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he
Daniel 8:25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
Daniel 8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
Daniel 8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose
Daniel 9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
Daniel 9:3 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
Daniel 9:6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which
Daniel 9:7 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
Daniel 9:8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
Daniel 9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
Daniel 9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
Daniel 9:12 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
Daniel 9:13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon
Daniel 9:14 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
Daniel 9:15 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out
Daniel 9:16 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let
Daniel 9:17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
Daniel 9:18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
Daniel 9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
Daniel 9:20 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and
Daniel 9:22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am
Daniel 9:23 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,
Daniel 9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
Daniel 9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
Daniel 9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but
Daniel 9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in
Daniel 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
Daniel 10:2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
Daniel 10:3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
Daniel 10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by
Daniel 10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
Daniel 10:8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
Daniel 10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of
Daniel 10:10 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and
Daniel 10:11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand
Daniel 10:12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
Daniel 10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
Daniel 10:14 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
Daniel 10:15 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward
Daniel 10:16 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
Daniel 10:17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
Daniel 10:18 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
Daniel 10:20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
Daniel 10:21 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
Daniel 11:1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
Daniel 11:2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up
Daniel 11:3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
Daniel 11:4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
Daniel 11:5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
Daniel 11:6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for
Daniel 11:7 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
Daniel 11:9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
Daniel 11:10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude
Daniel 11:11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall
Daniel 11:12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
Daniel 11:13 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
Daniel 11:14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of
Daniel 11:15 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
Daniel 11:16 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
Daniel 11:17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
Daniel 11:18 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
Daniel 11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but
Daniel 11:20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
Daniel 11:21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
Daniel 11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
Daniel 11:23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
Daniel 11:24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
Daniel 11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
Daniel 11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
Daniel 11:27 And both of these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and
Daniel 11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
Daniel 11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
Daniel 11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
Daniel 11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
Daniel 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
Daniel 11:33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
Daniel 11:34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
Daniel 11:35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
Daniel 11:36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
Daniel 11:37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
Daniel 11:38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
Daniel 11:39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
Daniel 11:40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
Daniel 11:41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
Daniel 11:42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the
Daniel 11:43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
Daniel 11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
Daniel 11:45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
Daniel 12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
Daniel 12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
Daniel 12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to
Daniel 12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one
Daniel 12:6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
Daniel 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
Daniel 12:8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what
Daniel 12:10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
Daniel 12:11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,
Daniel 12:12 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
Daniel 12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest,
Hosea 1:1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in
Hosea 1:2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said
Hosea 1:3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
Hosea 1:4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
Hosea 1:5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow
Hosea 1:6 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto
Hosea 1:7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them
Hosea 1:8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
Hosea 1:9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and
Hosea 1:10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
Hosea 1:11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
Hosea 2:1 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Hosea 2:2 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am
Hosea 2:4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
Hosea 2:5 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them
Hosea 2:6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a
Hosea 2:7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
Hosea 2:8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
Hosea 2:9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
Hosea 2:10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
Hosea 2:11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new
Hosea 2:12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
Hosea 2:13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
Hosea 2:14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
Hosea 2:15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of
Hosea 2:16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call
Hosea 2:17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
Hosea 2:18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
Hosea 2:19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
Hosea 2:20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt
Hosea 2:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
Hosea 2:23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
Hosea 3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her
Hosea 3:2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
Hosea 3:4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king,
Hosea 4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
Hosea 4:2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
Hosea 4:3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
Hosea 4:4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as
Hosea 4:5 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall
Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
Hosea 4:7 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will
Hosea 4:8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
Hosea 4:9 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish
Hosea 4:10 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
Hosea 4:11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
Hosea 4:12 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth
Hosea 4:13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense
Hosea 4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor
Hosea 4:15 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend;
Hosea 4:16 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
Hosea 4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
Hosea 4:18 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
Hosea 4:19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
Hosea 5:1 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give
Hosea 5:2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have
Hosea 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
Hosea 5:4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the
Hosea 5:5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
Hosea 5:6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
Hosea 5:7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
Hosea 5:8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
Hosea 5:9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes
Hosea 5:10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
Hosea 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly
Hosea 5:12 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of
Hosea 5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went
Hosea 5:14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the
Hosea 5:15 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
Hosea 6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he
Hosea 6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise
Hosea 6:3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going
Hosea 6:4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
Hosea 6:5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by
Hosea 6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God
Hosea 6:7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they
Hosea 6:8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with
Hosea 6:9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests
Hosea 6:10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
Hosea 6:11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned
Hosea 7:1 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
Hosea 7:2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
Hosea 7:3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
Hosea 7:4 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
Hosea 7:5 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
Hosea 7:6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie
Hosea 7:7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all
Hosea 7:8 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake
Hosea 7:9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,
Hosea 7:10 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not
Hosea 7:11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
Hosea 7:12 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring
Hosea 7:13 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!
Hosea 7:14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
Hosea 7:15 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
Hosea 7:16 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful
Hosea 8:1 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against
Hosea 8:2 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
Hosea 8:3 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
Hosea 8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and
Hosea 8:5 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
Hosea 8:7 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it
Hosea 8:8 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a
Hosea 8:9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
Hosea 8:10 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather
Hosea 8:11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
Hosea 8:12 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were
Hosea 8:13 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
Hosea 8:14 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
Hosea 9:1 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
Hosea 9:2 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine
Hosea 9:3 They shall not dwell in the LORD’s land; but Ephraim shall return
Hosea 9:4 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
Hosea 9:5 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of
Hosea 9:7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come;
Hosea 9:8 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
Hosea 9:9 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah:
Hosea 9:10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers
Hosea 9:11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the
Hosea 9:12 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
Hosea 9:14 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying
Hosea 9:15 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
Hosea 9:16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
Hosea 9:17 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
Hosea 10:1 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
Hosea 10:2 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall
Hosea 10:3 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
Hosea 10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
Hosea 10:6 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
Hosea 10:7 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
Hosea 10:8 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
Hosea 10:9 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
Hosea 10:10 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
Hosea 10:11 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread
Hosea 10:12 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your
Hosea 10:13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
Hosea 10:14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
Hosea 10:15 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in
Hosea 11:1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out
Hosea 11:2 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto
Hosea 11:3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they
Hosea 11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to
Hosea 11:5 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
Hosea 11:6 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
Hosea 11:7 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called
Hosea 11:8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
Hosea 11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
Hosea 11:10 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when
Hosea 11:11 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of
Hosea 11:12 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
Hosea 12:1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
Hosea 12:2 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
Hosea 12:3 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength
Hosea 12:6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait
Hosea 12:7 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
Hosea 12:8 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
Hosea 12:9 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
Hosea 12:10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
Hosea 12:11 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
Hosea 12:12 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for
Hosea 12:13 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a
Hosea 12:14 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he
Hosea 13:1 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but
Hosea 13:2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images
Hosea 13:3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew

Haggai 1:3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, 1:4
Haggai 1:6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not

Haggai 1:8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I
Haggai 1:9 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought
Haggai 1:10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth
Haggai 1:11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,
Haggai 1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
Haggai 1:13 Then spake Haggai the LORD’s messenger in the LORD’s message unto
Haggai 1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Haggai 2:1 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month,
Haggai 2:6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while,
Haggai 2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.
Haggai 2:9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the

Haggai 2:15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from

Zechariah 1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word
Zechariah 1:3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn
Zechariah 1:4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
Zechariah 1:5 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for
Zechariah 1:7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is
Zechariah 1:9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked
Zechariah 1:10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said,
Zechariah 1:11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
Zechariah 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
Zechariah 1:14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
Zechariah 1:15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease:
Zechariah 1:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
Zechariah 1:17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through
Zechariah 1:18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
Zechariah 1:19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And
Zechariah 1:20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.
Zechariah 1:21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These
Zechariah 2:1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a
Zechariah 2:2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
Zechariah 2:3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another
Zechariah 2:6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the
Zechariah 2:7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
Zechariah 2:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me
Zechariah 2:9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a

Zechariah 2:12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
Zechariah 2:13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out
Zechariah 3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
Zechariah 3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even
Zechariah 3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
Zechariah 3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a

Zechariah 3:7 Thus
Zechariah 3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit
Zechariah 3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one

Zechariah 4:1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a
Zechariah 4:2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and
Zechariah 4:4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying,
Zechariah 4:6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of
Zechariah 4:7 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
Zechariah 4:8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 4:9
Zechariah 4:9 The hands
Zechariah 4:10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall

Zechariah 4:14 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the
Zechariah 5:1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a
Zechariah 5:2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
Zechariah 5:3 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the
Zechariah 5:4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter
Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me,
Zechariah 5:6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth
Zechariah 5:7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a
Zechariah 5:8 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of
Zechariah 5:9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came
Zechariah 5:10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
Zechariah 6:1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold,
Zechariah 6:2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot
Zechariah 6:4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What
Zechariah 6:6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
Zechariah 6:7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to
Zechariah 6:8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these
Zechariah 6:9 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:10
Zechariah 6:10 Take of them
Zechariah 6:14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,
Zechariah 6:15 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of
Zechariah 7:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the
Zechariah 7:7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
Zechariah 7:9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment,
Zechariah 7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
Zechariah 7:12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should
Zechariah 7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
Zechariah 8:1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 8:2
Zechariah 8:2 Thus
Zechariah 8:3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in
Zechariah 8:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
Zechariah 8:5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
Zechariah 8:6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of
Zechariah 8:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from
Zechariah 8:9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that
Zechariah 8:10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for
Zechariah 8:11 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the
Zechariah 8:12 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit,
Zechariah 8:13 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
Zechariah 8:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
Zechariah 8:16 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
Zechariah 8:18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 8:19
Zechariah 8:19 Thus
Zechariah 8:20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
Zechariah 8:22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD
Zechariah 8:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
Zechariah 9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
Zechariah 9:2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it
Zechariah 9:3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as
Zechariah 9:4 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in
Zechariah 9:5 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be
Zechariah 9:6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride
Zechariah 9:7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
Zechariah 9:8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of
Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
Zechariah 9:10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
Zechariah 9:11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth
Zechariah 9:12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do
Zechariah 9:14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go
Zechariah 9:15 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and
Zechariah 9:16 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock
Zechariah 9:17 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn
Zechariah 10:1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
Zechariah 10:2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
Zechariah 10:3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the
Zechariah 10:4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him
Zechariah 10:5 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies
Zechariah 10:6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
Zechariah 10:7 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart
Zechariah 10:8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them:
Zechariah 10:9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me
Zechariah 10:10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
Zechariah 10:11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
Zechariah 10:12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
Zechariah 11:1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
Zechariah 11:2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are
Zechariah 11:3 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory
Zechariah 11:4 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5
Zechariah 11:6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
Zechariah 11:7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the
Zechariah 11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed
Zechariah 11:9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
Zechariah 11:10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
Zechariah 11:11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that
Zechariah 11:12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if
Zechariah 11:13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
Zechariah 11:14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might

Zechariah 11:16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not

Zechariah 12:2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
Zechariah 12:3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
Zechariah 12:4 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
Zechariah 12:5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
Zechariah 12:6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of
Zechariah 12:7 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory
Zechariah 12:8 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
Zechariah 12:9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
Zechariah 12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
Zechariah 12:11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the
Zechariah 12:12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the
Zechariah 13:1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
Zechariah 13:2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
Zechariah 13:3 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then
Zechariah 13:4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be
Zechariah 13:6 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?
Zechariah 13:7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is
Zechariah 13:8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD,
Zechariah 13:9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine
Zechariah 14:1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
Zechariah 14:2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
Zechariah 14:3 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as
Zechariah 14:4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
Zechariah 14:5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley
Zechariah 14:6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not
Zechariah 14:8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from
Zechariah 14:9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall
Zechariah 14:10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
Zechariah 14:11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
Zechariah 14:12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
Zechariah 14:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from
Zechariah 14:14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
Zechariah 14:15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
Zechariah 14:16 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
Zechariah 14:17 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families
Zechariah 14:18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no
Zechariah 14:19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all
Zechariah 14:20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
Zechariah 14:21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto
Malachi 1:1 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
Malachi 1:2 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
Malachi 1:4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and
Malachi 1:5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
Malachi 1:6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be
Malachi 1:8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye
Malachi 1:9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:
Malachi 1:10 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?
Malachi 1:11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
Malachi 1:12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is
Malachi 1:13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed
Malachi 1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and
Malachi 2:1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
Malachi 2:2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give
Malachi 2:3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
Malachi 2:4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that
Malachi 2:5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
Malachi 2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in
Malachi 2:7 For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek
Malachi 2:8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble
Malachi 2:9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all
Malachi 2:10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do
Malachi 2:12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
Malachi 2:13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with
Malachi 2:14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between
Malachi 2:15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
Malachi 2:16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
Malachi 2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
Malachi 3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when
Malachi 3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
Malachi 3:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
Malachi 3:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
Malachi 3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are

Matthew 2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
Matthew 2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the

Matthew 2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
Matthew 2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Matthew 2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
Matthew 2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
Matthew 2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,

Matthew 2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
Matthew 2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came

Matthew 3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
Matthew 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
Matthew 3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern

Matthew 6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
Matthew 6:2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
Matthew 6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy

Matthew 7:20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Matthew 7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
Matthew 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
Matthew 7:24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
Matthew 7:26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
Matthew 7:28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
Matthew 8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
Matthew 8:2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
Matthew 8:3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be

Matthew 8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
Matthew 8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I

Matthew 8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
Matthew 8:13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
Matthew 8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s
Matthew 8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,
Matthew 8:16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were

Matthew 8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
Matthew 8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
Matthew 8:21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first
Matthew 8:22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
Matthew 8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
Matthew 8:24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
Matthew 8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
Matthew 8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
Matthew 8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that
Matthew 8:29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
Matthew 8:31 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer
Matthew 8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
Matthew 8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,
Matthew 8:34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they
Matthew 9:1 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
Matthew 9:2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
Matthew 9:3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This
Matthew 9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
Matthew 9:7 And he arose, and departed to his house.
Matthew 9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
Matthew 9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
Matthew 9:10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
Matthew 9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
Matthew 9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
Matthew 9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
Matthew 9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
Matthew 9:17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
Matthew 9:18 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
Matthew 9:19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
Matthew 9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
Matthew 9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
Matthew 9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
Matthew 9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels
Matthew 9:25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
Matthew 9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
Matthew 9:27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
Matthew 9:28 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him:
Matthew 9:29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
Matthew 9:30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
Matthew 9:31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all
Matthew 9:32 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
Matthew 9:33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
Matthew 9:34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince
Matthew 9:35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
Matthew 9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
Matthew 9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
Matthew 10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
Matthew 10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,
Matthew 10:5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
Matthew 10:7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
Matthew 10:9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10:10
Matthew 10:11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in
Matthew 10:12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.
Matthew 10:13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if
Matthew 10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
Matthew 10:15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
Matthew 10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
Matthew 10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
Matthew 10:19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
Matthew 10:20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
Matthew 10:21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
Matthew 10:22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that
Matthew 10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:
Matthew 10:24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
Matthew 10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye
Matthew 10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
Matthew 10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
Matthew 10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew 10:31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
Matthew 10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
Matthew 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
Matthew 10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
Matthew 10:36 And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.
Matthew 10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
Matthew 10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
Matthew 10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
Matthew 10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
Matthew 10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
Matthew 10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
Matthew 11:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
Matthew 11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
Matthew 11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
Matthew 11:7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
Matthew 11:9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,
Matthew 11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
Matthew 11:11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
Matthew 11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
Matthew 11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew 11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
Matthew 11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew 11:16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
Matthew 11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath
Matthew 11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a
Matthew 11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
Matthew 11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
Matthew 11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
Matthew 11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land
Matthew 11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Matthew 11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
Matthew 11:27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
Matthew 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
Matthew 11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
Matthew 11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
Matthew 12:1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
Matthew 12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
Matthew 12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he
Matthew 12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
Matthew 12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
Matthew 12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
Matthew 12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
Matthew 12:10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
Matthew 12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
Matthew 12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
Matthew 12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
Matthew 12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
Matthew 12:19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
Matthew 12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
Matthew 12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
Matthew 12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
Matthew 12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
Matthew 12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
Matthew 12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
Matthew 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil
Matthew 12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
Matthew 12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
Matthew 12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
Matthew 12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
Matthew 12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
Matthew 12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
Matthew 12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
Matthew 12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
Matthew 12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
Matthew 12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
Matthew 12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
Matthew 12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
Matthew 12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
Matthew 12:44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
Matthew 12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
Matthew 12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
Matthew 12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
Matthew 12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
Matthew 12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
Matthew 13:1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
Matthew 13:2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
Matthew 13:3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
Matthew 13:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
Matthew 13:9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
Matthew 13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
Matthew 13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
Matthew 13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
Matthew 13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
Matthew 13:17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
Matthew 13:18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
Matthew 13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
Matthew 13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
Matthew 13:22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
Matthew 13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
Matthew 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
Matthew 13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
Matthew 13:27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
Matthew 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
Matthew 13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
Matthew 13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
Matthew 13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
Matthew 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and
Matthew 13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
Matthew 13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
Matthew 13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
Matthew 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
Matthew 13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
Matthew 13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
Matthew 13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
Matthew 13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
Matthew 13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
Matthew 13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
Matthew 13:53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
Matthew 13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
Matthew 13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
Matthew 13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
Matthew 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 14:2
Matthew 14:3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
Matthew 14:4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew 14:5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
Matthew 14:6 But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
Matthew 14:7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
Matthew 14:8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
Matthew 14:9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and
Matthew 14:10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew 14:11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:
Matthew 14:12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
Matthew 14:13 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
Matthew 14:14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
Matthew 14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This
Matthew 14:16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to
Matthew 14:17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
Matthew 14:18 He said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew 14:19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
Matthew 14:20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
Matthew 14:21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
Matthew 14:22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
Matthew 14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
Matthew 14:24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
Matthew 14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
Matthew 14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
Matthew 14:27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
Matthew 14:28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
Matthew 14:29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,
Matthew 14:30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
Matthew 14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,
Matthew 14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
Matthew 14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,
Matthew 14:34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
Matthew 14:35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
Matthew 15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
Matthew 15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
Matthew 15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
Matthew 15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 15:8
Matthew 15:8 This
Matthew 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
Matthew 15:10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
Matthew 15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
Matthew 15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
Matthew 15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
Matthew 15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 15:17
Matthew 15:17 Do
Matthew 15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
Matthew 15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Matthew 15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
Matthew 15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
Matthew 15:24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
Matthew 15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew 15:26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s
Matthew 15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
Matthew 15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
Matthew 15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
Matthew 15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that
Matthew 15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
Matthew 15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
Matthew 15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
Matthew 15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
Matthew 15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
Matthew 15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
Matthew 15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
Matthew 16:1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
Matthew 16:2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
Matthew 16:3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky
Matthew 16:5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
Matthew 16:6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
Matthew 16:7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
Matthew 16:8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
Matthew 16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
Matthew 16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
Matthew 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 16:16
Matthew 16:16 And Simon
Matthew 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
Matthew 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
Matthew 16:20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
Matthew 16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how
Matthew 16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
Matthew 16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
Matthew 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
Matthew 16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
Matthew 16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall
Matthew 17:1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
Matthew 17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
Matthew 17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
Matthew 17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
Matthew 17:6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
Matthew 17:7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
Matthew 17:8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
Matthew 17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
Matthew 17:10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
Matthew 17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
Matthew 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
Matthew 17:14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
Matthew 17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew 17:17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
Matthew 17:18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
Matthew 17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not
Matthew 17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
Matthew 17:22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
Matthew 17:24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
Matthew 17:25 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
Matthew 17:27 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,
Matthew 18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
Matthew 18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
Matthew 18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
Matthew 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
Matthew 18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that
Matthew 18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
Matthew 18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
Matthew 18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
Matthew 18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
Matthew 18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
Matthew 18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
Matthew 18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
Matthew 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
Matthew 18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
Matthew 18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
Matthew 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
Matthew 18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
Matthew 18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,
Matthew 18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which
Matthew 18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be
Matthew 18:26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
Matthew 18:27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
Matthew 18:28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
Matthew 18:29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
Matthew 18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
Matthew 18:31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
Matthew 18:32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
Matthew 18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
Matthew 19:1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,
Matthew 19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto
Matthew 19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
Matthew 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
Matthew 19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
Matthew 19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
Matthew 19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save
Matthew 19:12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
Matthew 19:13 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should
Matthew 19:14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to
Matthew 19:15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
Matthew 19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
Matthew 19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
Matthew 19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
Matthew 19:22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
Matthew 19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
Matthew 19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
Matthew 19:25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
Matthew 19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
Matthew 19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
Matthew 19:30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
Matthew 20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
Matthew 20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
Matthew 20:3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
Matthew 20:5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
Matthew 20:6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
Matthew 20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
Matthew 20:9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
Matthew 20:10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
Matthew 20:11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
Matthew 20:13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
Matthew 20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
Matthew 20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
Matthew 20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons,
Matthew 20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant
Matthew 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
Matthew 20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
Matthew 20:24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
Matthew 20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
Matthew 20:26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
Matthew 20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
Matthew 20:30 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
Matthew 20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
Matthew 20:32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
Matthew 20:34 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
Matthew 21:1 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
Matthew 21:2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
Matthew 21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
Matthew 21:4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
Matthew 21:6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 21:7
Matthew 21:7 And
Matthew 21:8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
Matthew 21:9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
Matthew 21:10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
Matthew 21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
Matthew 21:14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
Matthew 21:15 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
Matthew 21:18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
Matthew 21:19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
Matthew 21:20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
Matthew 21:22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
Matthew 21:23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
Matthew 21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And
Matthew 21:27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
Matthew 21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
Matthew 21:29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and
Matthew 21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
Matthew 21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto
Matthew 21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
Matthew 21:33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
Matthew 21:35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
Matthew 21:36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did
Matthew 21:37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
Matthew 21:38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
Matthew 21:39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
Matthew 21:40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do
Matthew 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
Matthew 21:43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
Matthew 21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
Matthew 21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
Matthew 21:46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
Matthew 22:1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
Matthew 22:4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
Matthew 22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
Matthew 22:7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth
Matthew 22:8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
Matthew 22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
Matthew 22:10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
Matthew 22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
Matthew 22:13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
Matthew 22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.
Matthew 22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
Matthew 22:16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
Matthew 22:17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
Matthew 22:20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Matthew 22:21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render
Matthew 22:22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
Matthew 22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is
Matthew 22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
Matthew 22:27 And last of all the woman died also.
Matthew 22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
Matthew 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
Matthew 22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
Matthew 22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
Matthew 22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
Matthew 22:34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
Matthew 22:35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
Matthew 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew 22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
Matthew 22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew 22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Matthew 22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
Matthew 22:43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
Matthew 23:1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 23:2
Matthew 23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
Matthew 23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
Matthew 23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
Matthew 23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;
Matthew 23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
Matthew 23:10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
Matthew 23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew 23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
Matthew 23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
Matthew 23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
Matthew 23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
Matthew 23:16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear
Matthew 23:19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
Matthew 23:21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him
Matthew 23:22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
Matthew 23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
Matthew 23:24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Matthew 23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
Matthew 23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup
Matthew 23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
Matthew 23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within
Matthew 23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
Matthew 23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
Matthew 23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Matthew 23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
Matthew 23:36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
Matthew 23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
Matthew 23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
Matthew 24:1 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
Matthew 24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
Matthew 24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
Matthew 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
Matthew 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not
Matthew 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
Matthew 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
Matthew 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
Matthew 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
Matthew 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
Matthew 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
Matthew 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
Matthew 24:15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
Matthew 24:19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
Matthew 24:22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
Matthew 24:23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
Matthew 24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
Matthew 24:25 Behold, I have told you before.
Matthew 24:26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
Matthew 24:27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
Matthew 24:28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
Matthew 24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
Matthew 24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
Matthew 24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
Matthew 24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
Matthew 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
Matthew 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
Matthew 24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son
Matthew 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
Matthew 24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
Matthew 24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,
Matthew 24:42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
Matthew 24:43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
Matthew 24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
Matthew 24:45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
Matthew 24:47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
Matthew 25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
Matthew 25:2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
Matthew 25:3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
Matthew 25:5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew 25:6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
Matthew 25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew 25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
Matthew 25:9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
Matthew 25:10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
Matthew 25:11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
Matthew 25:12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew 25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
Matthew 25:14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
Matthew 25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
Matthew 25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
Matthew 25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
Matthew 25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
Matthew 25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
Matthew 25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
Matthew 25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
Matthew 25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
Matthew 25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
Matthew 25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
Matthew 25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
Matthew 25:28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
Matthew 25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
Matthew 25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
Matthew 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
Matthew 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
Matthew 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
Matthew 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
Matthew 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
Matthew 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
Matthew 26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
Matthew 26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
Matthew 26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
Matthew 26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew 26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
Matthew 26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
Matthew 26:10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
Matthew 26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew 26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it
Matthew 26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
Matthew 26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
Matthew 26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
Matthew 26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
Matthew 26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
Matthew 26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
Matthew 26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of
Matthew 26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
Matthew 26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
Matthew 26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it
Matthew 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
Matthew 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
Matthew 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
Matthew 26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Matthew 26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
Matthew 26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew 26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
Matthew 26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
Matthew 26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
Matthew 26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
Matthew 26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
Matthew 26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
Matthew 26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
Matthew 26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
Matthew 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
Matthew 26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
Matthew 26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
Matthew 26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
Matthew 26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
Matthew 26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
Matthew 26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
Matthew 26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
Matthew 26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
Matthew 26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
Matthew 26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:
Matthew 26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
Matthew 26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
Matthew 26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
Matthew 26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,
Matthew 26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
Matthew 26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
Matthew 26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
Matthew 26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
Matthew 26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
Matthew 26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
Matthew 26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
Matthew 26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
Matthew 26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
Matthew 26:73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Matthew 26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
Matthew 26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
Matthew 27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
Matthew 27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
Matthew 27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
Matthew 27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
Matthew 27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field,
Matthew 27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
Matthew 27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
Matthew 27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,
Matthew 27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
Matthew 27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
Matthew 27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
Matthew 27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew 27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
Matthew 27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
Matthew 27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
Matthew 27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
Matthew 27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
Matthew 27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
Matthew 27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
Matthew 27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and
Matthew 27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
Matthew 27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
Matthew 27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew 27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
Matthew 27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
Matthew 27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
Matthew 27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
Matthew 27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
Matthew 27:36 And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37
Matthew 27:37 And set up over
Matthew 27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
Matthew 27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40
Matthew 27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
Matthew 27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
Matthew 27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
Matthew 27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
Matthew 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Matthew 27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
Matthew 27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
Matthew 27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
Matthew 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
Matthew 27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
Matthew 27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
Matthew 27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
Matthew 27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
Matthew 27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
Matthew 27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
Matthew 27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
Matthew 27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as
Matthew 27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
Matthew 28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
Matthew 28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the
Matthew 28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
Matthew 28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for
Matthew 28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
Matthew 28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
Matthew 28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
Matthew 28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
Matthew 28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
Matthew 28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
Matthew 28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
Matthew 28:14 And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him,
Matthew 28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
Matthew 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
Matthew 28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
Matthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
Mark 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 1:2
Mark 1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
Mark 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
Mark 1:5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
Mark 1:6 And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a
Mark 1:8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you
Mark 1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
Mark 1:10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
Mark 1:12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
Mark 1:13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
Mark 1:14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
Mark 1:16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
Mark 1:17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you
Mark 1:18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
Mark 1:19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
Mark 1:20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
Mark 1:21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day
Mark 1:22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as
Mark 1:23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
Mark 1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
Mark 1:26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
Mark 1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
Mark 1:28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
Mark 1:29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
Mark 1:30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
Mark 1:31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
Mark 1:32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that
Mark 1:33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark 1:34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
Mark 1:35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went
Mark 1:36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark 1:37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for
Mark 1:38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
Mark 1:39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
Mark 1:40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
Mark 1:41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
Mark 1:42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
Mark 1:43 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 1:44
Mark 1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
Mark 2:1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
Mark 2:2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there
Mark 2:3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
Mark 2:4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
Mark 2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
Mark 2:6 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
Mark 2:12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before
Mark 2:13 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
Mark 2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at
Mark 2:15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
Mark 2:16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
Mark 2:18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
Mark 2:20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
Mark 2:21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else
Mark 2:22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine
Mark 2:23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
Mark 2:24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
Mark 3:1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
Mark 3:2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
Mark 3:3 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
Mark 3:4 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
Mark 3:5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
Mark 3:6 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with
Mark 3:7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a
Mark 3:9 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on
Mark 3:10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for
Mark 3:11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
Mark 3:12 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
Mark 3:13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
Mark 3:14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he
Mark 3:17 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and
Mark 3:19 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into
Mark 3:20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not
Mark 3:21 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
Mark 3:22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
Mark 3:23 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
Mark 3:25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
Mark 3:26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot
Mark 3:27 No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,
Mark 3:28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
Mark 3:30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark 3:31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
Mark 3:32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,
Mark 3:33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
Mark 3:34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
Mark 4:1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
Mark 4:2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in
Mark 4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
Mark 4:7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
Mark 4:8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
Mark 4:9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve
Mark 4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
Mark 4:13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
Mark 4:15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
Mark 4:16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
Mark 4:17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
Mark 4:18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
Mark 4:20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
Mark 4:21 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
Mark 4:23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
Mark 4:25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
Mark 4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
Mark 4:28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
Mark 4:29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
Mark 4:30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
Mark 4:33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they
Mark 4:34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were
Mark 4:35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let
Mark 4:36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
Mark 4:37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
Mark 4:38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
Mark 4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
Mark 5:2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him
Mark 5:5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
Mark 5:6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7
Mark 5:7 And
Mark 5:8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
Mark 5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My
Mark 5:10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
Mark 5:11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
Mark 5:12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,
Mark 5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
Mark 5:14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
Mark 5:15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
Mark 5:16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
Mark 5:17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
Mark 5:18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
Mark 5:19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
Mark 5:20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
Mark 5:21 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
Mark 5:22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
Mark 5:24 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
Mark 5:25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark 5:26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
Mark 5:27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
Mark 5:28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
Mark 5:29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
Mark 5:30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
Mark 5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
Mark 5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;
Mark 5:35 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s
Mark 5:37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and
Mark 5:38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
Mark 5:39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
Mark 5:40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
Mark 5:41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
Mark 5:42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the
Mark 5:43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
Mark 6:1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
Mark 6:2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
Mark 6:4 But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in
Mark 6:5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
Mark 6:6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
Mark 6:7 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
Mark 6:10 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
Mark 6:11 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
Mark 6:12 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
Mark 6:13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
Mark 6:14 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
Mark 6:15 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
Mark 6:16 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
Mark 6:17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
Mark 6:18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have
Mark 6:19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
Mark 6:21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
Mark 6:23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
Mark 6:24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?
Mark 6:25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
Mark 6:26 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and
Mark 6:27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
Mark 6:29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
Mark 6:30 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
Mark 6:31 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
Mark 6:32 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
Mark 6:33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
Mark 6:34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
Mark 6:35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,
Mark 6:37 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
Mark 6:39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
Mark 6:40 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark 6:41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
Mark 6:42 And they did all eat, and were filled.
Mark 6:43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
Mark 6:44 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
Mark 6:45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
Mark 6:46 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
Mark 6:47 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and
Mark 6:48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
Mark 6:49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had
Mark 6:51 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
Mark 6:52 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
Mark 6:53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
Mark 6:54 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
Mark 6:56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
Mark 7:1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
Mark 7:2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,
Mark 7:3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
Mark 7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
Mark 7:5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
Mark 7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
Mark 7:8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
Mark 7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
Mark 7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
Mark 7:12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
Mark 7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
Mark 7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
Mark 7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do
Mark 7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
Mark 7:24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
Mark 7:25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
Mark 7:27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it
Mark 7:28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under
Mark 7:29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
Mark 7:30 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
Mark 7:31 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
Mark 7:32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
Mark 7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
Mark 7:35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
Mark 7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he
Mark 8:1 In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
Mark 8:4 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
Mark 8:6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took
Mark 8:7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to
Mark 8:8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
Mark 8:9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them
Mark 8:10 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
Mark 8:11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
Mark 8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
Mark 8:13 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
Mark 8:14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
Mark 8:15 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
Mark 8:16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
Mark 8:17 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
Mark 8:20 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
Mark 8:21 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? 8:22
Mark 8:23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
Mark 8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
Mark 8:25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
Mark 8:26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
Mark 8:27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Mark 8:29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
Mark 8:30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark 8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
Mark 8:32 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
Mark 8:33 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
Mark 8:34 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
Mark 8:35 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
Mark 9:1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some
Mark 9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
Mark 9:3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
Mark 9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
Mark 9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to
Mark 9:6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
Mark 9:7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out
Mark 9:8 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man
Mark 9:9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
Mark 9:10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
Mark 9:11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must
Mark 9:13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
Mark 9:14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
Mark 9:15 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
Mark 9:16 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 9:17
Mark 9:17 And
Mark 9:19 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
Mark 9:20 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway
Mark 9:21 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
Mark 9:22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,
Mark 9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
Mark 9:24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
Mark 9:25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked
Mark 9:26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and
Mark 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
Mark 9:28 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
Mark 9:30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
Mark 9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man
Mark 9:32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark 9:33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,
Mark 9:35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If
Mark 9:36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when
Mark 9:38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
Mark 9:39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall
Mark 9:40 For he that is not against us is on our part.
Mark 9:41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
Mark 9:42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
Mark 9:43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
Mark 9:45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
Mark 9:47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee
Mark 9:49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
Mark 9:50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith
Mark 10:1 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
Mark 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a
Mark 10:3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark 10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
Mark 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your
Mark 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
Mark 10:7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
Mark 10:9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark 10:10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
Mark 10:11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
Mark 10:12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
Mark 10:13 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
Mark 10:14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
Mark 10:15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
Mark 10:16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
Mark 10:17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
Mark 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
Mark 10:21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing
Mark 10:22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had
Mark 10:23 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How
Mark 10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
Mark 10:26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
Mark 10:28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
Mark 10:29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
Mark 10:30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
Mark 10:31 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark 10:32 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
Mark 10:35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
Mark 10:36 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark 10:37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
Mark 10:38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink
Mark 10:41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
Mark 10:42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that
Mark 10:43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
Mark 10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
Mark 10:46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
Mark 10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
Mark 10:48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried
Mark 10:49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they
Mark 10:50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
Mark 10:51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
Mark 10:52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
Mark 11:1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
Mark 11:3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
Mark 11:4 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
Mark 11:5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,
Mark 11:7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
Mark 11:8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
Mark 11:9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
Mark 11:11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when
Mark 11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
Mark 11:14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
Mark 11:15 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and
Mark 11:17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
Mark 11:18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
Mark 11:19 And when even was come, he went out of the city.
Mark 11:20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
Mark 11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,
Mark 11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark 11:23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
Mark 11:25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
Mark 11:26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
Mark 11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
Mark 11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
Mark 11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
Mark 11:33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
Mark 12:1 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
Mark 12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
Mark 12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
Mark 12:4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
Mark 12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
Mark 12:6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
Mark 12:7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
Mark 12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
Mark 12:9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
Mark 12:10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
Mark 12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Mark 12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
Mark 12:16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
Mark 12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things
Mark 12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
Mark 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
Mark 12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and
Mark 12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
Mark 12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
Mark 12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
Mark 12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
Mark 12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
Mark 12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
Mark 12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
Mark 12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
Mark 12:35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How
Mark 12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
Mark 12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
Mark 12:41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
Mark 12:42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
Mark 12:43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Mark 13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
Mark 13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
Mark 13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
Mark 13:7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
Mark 13:8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
Mark 13:9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
Mark 13:10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
Mark 13:11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
Mark 13:12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
Mark 13:13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that
Mark 13:14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
Mark 13:16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
Mark 13:17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck
Mark 13:19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
Mark 13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
Mark 13:21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
Mark 13:23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
Mark 13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
Mark 13:26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
Mark 13:27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
Mark 13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
Mark 13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
Mark 13:31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
Mark 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
Mark 13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark 13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
Mark 13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
Mark 13:37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
Mark 14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
Mark 14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of
Mark 14:3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
Mark 14:4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
Mark 14:6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
Mark 14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
Mark 14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
Mark 14:9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
Mark 14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
Mark 14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
Mark 14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
Mark 14:14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
Mark 14:16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found
Mark 14:17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark 14:18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
Mark 14:19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
Mark 14:21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
Mark 14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
Mark 14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to
Mark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
Mark 14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
Mark 14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Mark 14:27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
Mark 14:28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark 14:29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
Mark 14:30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
Mark 14:31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
Mark 14:32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
Mark 14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
Mark 14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
Mark 14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
Mark 14:37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
Mark 14:39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
Mark 14:40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
Mark 14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
Mark 14:42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark 14:43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
Mark 14:44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
Mark 14:45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
Mark 14:46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
Mark 14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
Mark 14:48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
Mark 14:50 And they all forsook him, and fled.
Mark 14:51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
Mark 14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
Mark 14:54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
Mark 14:55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
Mark 14:56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
Mark 14:57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
Mark 14:59 But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark 14:60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
Mark 14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
Mark 14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
Mark 14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
Mark 14:68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
Mark 14:69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
Mark 14:70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
Mark 14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man
Mark 14:72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the
Mark 15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
Mark 15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
Mark 15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered
Mark 15:4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
Mark 15:5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark 15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
Mark 15:7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that
Mark 15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
Mark 15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you
Mark 15:11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
Mark 15:12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
Mark 15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
Mark 15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
Mark 15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
Mark 15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
Mark 15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
Mark 15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
Mark 15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
Mark 15:23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
Mark 15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
Mark 15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark 15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
Mark 15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
Mark 15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
Mark 15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
Mark 15:31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
Mark 15:32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
Mark 15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
Mark 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Mark 15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
Mark 15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark 15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
Mark 15:39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
Mark 15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
Mark 15:42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
Mark 15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
Mark 15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
Mark 15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in
Mark 15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he
Mark 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
Mark 16:2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
Mark 16:3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone
Mark 16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on
Mark 16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
Mark 16:7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
Mark 16:8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
Mark 16:9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
Mark 16:10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
Mark 16:11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
Mark 16:12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
Mark 16:13 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
Mark 16:14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
Mark 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
Mark 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall

Mark 16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working
Luke 1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
Luke 1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
Luke 1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
Luke 1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the

Luke 1:8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office
Luke 1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
Luke 1:11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
Luke 1:12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
Luke 1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer
Luke 1:14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at
Luke 1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
Luke 1:16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
Luke 1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to
Luke 1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for
Luke 1:19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
Luke 1:20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
Luke 1:21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
Luke 1:22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
Luke 1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
Luke 1:24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
Luke 1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
Luke 1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
Luke 1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in
Luke 1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
Luke 1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
Luke 1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
Luke 1:33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
Luke 1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know
Luke 1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
Luke 1:39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
Luke 1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Luke 1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come
Luke 1:45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
Luke 1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47
Luke 1:47 And my spirit
Luke 1:48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
Luke 1:49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is
Luke 1:50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
Luke 1:51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud
Luke 1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of
Luke 1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath
Luke 1:54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
Luke 1:55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
Luke 1:56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
Luke 1:57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and
Luke 1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
Luke 1:59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
Luke 1:60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called
Luke 1:61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
Luke 1:62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
Luke 1:63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
Luke 1:64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
Luke 1:65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these
Luke 1:66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
Luke 1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
Luke 1:76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for

Luke 2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
Luke 2:12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped
Luke 2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly

Luke 2:16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
Luke 2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
Luke 2:18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were

Luke 2:28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 2:29
Luke 2:33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
Luke 2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
Luke 2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of

Luke 5:1 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear

Luke 7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
Luke 7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,
Luke 7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger

Luke 7:40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say

Luke 10:22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
Luke 10:23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
Luke 10:25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Luke 10:28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
Luke 10:29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is
Luke 10:31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
Luke 10:32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked
Luke 10:33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
Luke 10:35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
Luke 10:36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him

Luke 10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,

Luke 11:4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is

Luke 11:47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
Luke 11:48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
Luke 11:49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets

Luke 12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
Luke 12:14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
Luke 12:16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
Luke 12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
Luke 12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
Luke 12:22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
Luke 12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.
Luke 12:24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
Luke 12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
Luke 12:30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
Luke 12:31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
Luke 12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to
Luke 12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which
Luke 12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Luke 12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 12:36
Luke 12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
Luke 12:38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
Luke 12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
Luke 12:40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
Luke 12:41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
Luke 12:44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
Luke 12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
Luke 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not
Luke 12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
Luke 12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
Luke 12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
Luke 12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against
Luke 12:54 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
Luke 12:55 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;
Luke 12:56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the

Luke 13:6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted
Luke 13:7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
Luke 13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
Luke 13:11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
Luke 13:12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
Luke 13:13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
Luke 13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
Luke 13:15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
Luke 13:18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
Luke 13:20 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke 13:21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
Luke 13:22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
Luke 13:23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
Luke 13:25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
Luke 13:27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
Luke 13:28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
Luke 13:29 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
Luke 13:30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
Luke 13:31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
Luke 13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast
Luke 13:33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
Luke 13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
Luke 14:1 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
Luke 14:2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
Luke 14:3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
Luke 14:6 And they could not answer him again to these things.
Luke 14:7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
Luke 14:8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
Luke 14:9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
Luke 14:10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
Luke 14:11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
Luke 14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
Luke 14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
Luke 14:15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
Luke 14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
Luke 14:18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
Luke 14:19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
Luke 14:20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
Luke 14:21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
Luke 14:22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
Luke 14:23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
Luke 14:24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
Luke 14:25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
Luke 14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot
Luke 14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
Luke 14:29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able

Luke 14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
Luke 14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
Luke 15:1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
Luke 15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
Luke 15:3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 15:4
Luke 15:4 What man of

Luke 15:12 And the younger
Luke 15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
Luke 15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
Luke 15:15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and
Luke 15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
Luke 15:17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
Luke 15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
Luke 15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
Luke 15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
Luke 15:22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
Luke 15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
Luke 15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
Luke 15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
Luke 15:27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
Luke 15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
Luke 15:29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
Luke 15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
Luke 15:32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy

Luke 16:2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
Luke 16:3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
Luke 16:4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the

Luke 16:7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An

Luke 16:9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
Luke 16:10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
Luke 16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
Luke 16:14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
Luke 16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
Luke 16:16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
Luke 16:17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
Luke 16:18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
Luke 16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
Luke 16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
Luke 16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
Luke 16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
Luke 16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
Luke 16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
Luke 16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
Luke 16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from
Luke 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
Luke 17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
Luke 17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
Luke 17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven
Luke 17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
Luke 17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye

Luke 17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
Luke 17:11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
Luke 17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
Luke 17:14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
Luke 17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
Luke 17:17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where
Luke 17:19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
Luke 17:20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
Luke 17:22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
Luke 17:23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
Luke 17:24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under
Luke 17:25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
Luke 17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
Luke 17:27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
Luke 17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
Luke 17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
Luke 17:31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
Luke 17:32 Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke 17:33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
Luke 17:34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the
Luke 17:35 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
Luke 17:36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
Luke 17:37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
Luke 18:4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
Luke 18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
Luke 18:7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
Luke 18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
Luke 18:12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
Luke 18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
Luke 18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
Luke 18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
Luke 18:16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
Luke 18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
Luke 18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I
Luke 18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
Luke 18:21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
Luke 18:22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
Luke 18:23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
Luke 18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
Luke 18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than
Luke 18:26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 18:27
Luke 18:27 And
Luke 18:28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
Luke 18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
Luke 18:31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we
Luke 18:32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
Luke 18:34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
Luke 18:35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
Luke 18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
Luke 18:38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
Luke 18:39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
Luke 18:40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
Luke 18:42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
Luke 18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
Luke 19:1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
Luke 19:2 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief
Luke 19:3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
Luke 19:4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
Luke 19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and
Luke 19:6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
Luke 19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone
Luke 19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
Luke 19:9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
Luke 19:11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
Luke 19:12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
Luke 19:13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
Luke 19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
Luke 19:15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
Luke 19:16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
Luke 19:17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast
Luke 19:18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
Luke 19:19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
Luke 19:20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which
Luke 19:22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
Luke 19:25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 19:26
Luke 19:26 For I
Luke 19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
Luke 19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
Luke 19:29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Luke 19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
Luke 19:32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had
Luke 19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto
Luke 19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon
Luke 19:36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
Luke 19:37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount
Luke 19:39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
Luke 19:40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
Luke 19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
Luke 19:42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
Luke 19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
Luke 19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
Luke 19:47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the
Luke 20:1 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the
Luke 20:7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
Luke 20:8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
Luke 20:9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
Luke 20:10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
Luke 20:11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
Luke 20:12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
Luke 20:13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send
Luke 20:14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
Luke 20:15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
Luke 20:17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
Luke 20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
Luke 20:20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
Luke 20:21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
Luke 20:25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
Luke 20:26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and
Luke 20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there
Luke 20:29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,
Luke 20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
Luke 20:31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
Luke 20:32 Last of all the woman died also.
Luke 20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
Luke 20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
Luke 20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
Luke 20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
Luke 20:39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
Luke 20:40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
Luke 20:41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?
Luke 20:42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
Luke 20:44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? 20:45
Luke 20:46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
Luke 21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
Luke 21:2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
Luke 21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
Luke 21:5 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
Luke 21:7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things
Luke 21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
Luke 21:9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
Luke 21:10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
Luke 21:12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
Luke 21:13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Luke 21:14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what
Luke 21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
Luke 21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
Luke 21:18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke 21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.
Luke 21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
Luke 21:21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
Luke 21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
Luke 21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
Luke 21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
Luke 21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
Luke 21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
Luke 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
Luke 21:29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
Luke 21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
Luke 21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till
Luke 21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
Luke 21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
Luke 21:35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
Luke 21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
Luke 21:37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
Luke 21:38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
Luke 22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
Luke 22:2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;
Luke 22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
Luke 22:4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
Luke 22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
Luke 22:6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
Luke 22:7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
Luke 22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
Luke 22:9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 22:10
Luke 22:11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
Luke 22:13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
Luke 22:14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
Luke 22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
Luke 22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
Luke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
Luke 22:21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
Luke 22:22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
Luke 22:24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
Luke 22:25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
Luke 22:26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
Luke 22:27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
Luke 22:28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
Luke 22:29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
Luke 22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
Luke 22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
Luke 22:35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,
Luke 22:36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
Luke 22:37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
Luke 22:38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
Luke 22:39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
Luke 22:40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
Luke 22:41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled
Luke 22:43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
Luke 22:44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
Luke 22:45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
Luke 22:47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
Luke 22:48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
Luke 22:50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
Luke 22:51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
Luke 22:52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
Luke 22:54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
Luke 22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
Luke 22:56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
Luke 22:57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
Luke 22:58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
Luke 22:59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
Luke 22:60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
Luke 22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
Luke 22:62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke 22:63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
Luke 22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,
Luke 22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
Luke 22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
Luke 22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said

Luke 23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
Luke 23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
Luke 23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find
Luke 23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
Luke 23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a

Luke 23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
Luke 23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
Luke 23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
Luke 23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,
Luke 23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
Luke 23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
Luke 23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
Luke 23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
Luke 23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
Luke 23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
Luke 23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
Luke 23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might

Luke 23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was

Luke 23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
Luke 23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
Luke 23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Luke 23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
Luke 23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
Luke 23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
Luke 23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
Luke 23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
Luke 23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
Luke 23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Luke 23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
Luke 23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
Luke 23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
Luke 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
Luke 23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
Luke 23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
Luke 23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
Luke 23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Luke 23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
Luke 23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Luke 23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
Luke 23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke 23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
Luke 23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
Luke 24:1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
Luke 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
Luke 24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
Luke 24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
Luke 24:8 And they remembered his words, 24:9
Luke 24:9 And returned from the
Luke 24:10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,
Luke 24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
Luke 24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
Luke 24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
Luke 24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
Luke 24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
Luke 24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
Luke 24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
Luke 24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
Luke 24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
Luke 24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
Luke 24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
Luke 24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
Luke 24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
Luke 24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
Luke 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,
Luke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
Luke 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
Luke 24:35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
Luke 24:36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
Luke 24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
Luke 24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
Luke 24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
Luke 24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
Luke 24:43 And he took it, and did eat before them.
Luke 24:44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
Luke 24:45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
Luke 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
Luke 24:48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
Luke 24:50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his

Luke 24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
Luke 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Luke 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.
Luke 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
Luke 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
Luke 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
Luke 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
Luke 1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
Luke 1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
Luke 1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
Luke 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
Luke 1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
Luke 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the

Luke 1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom

Luke 1:22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
Luke 1:24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
Luke 1:25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
Luke 1:28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
Luke 1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
Luke 1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
Luke 1:31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
Luke 1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
Luke 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
Luke 1:34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
Luke 1:35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
Luke 1:36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
Luke 1:38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
Luke 1:40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
Luke 1:41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We

Luke 1:43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
Luke 1:44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Luke 1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,
Luke 1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
Luke 1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Luke 1:49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of

Luke 2:1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
Luke 2:3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
Luke 2:4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
Luke 2:5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
Luke 2:6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
Luke 2:7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they

Luke 2:9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
Luke 2:11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
Luke 2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
Luke 2:13 And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Luke 2:14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
Luke 2:17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
Luke 2:18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
Luke 2:20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
Luke 2:22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
Luke 2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,
Luke 2:24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
Luke 3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Luke 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Luke 3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
Luke 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
Luke 3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
Luke 3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
Luke 3:9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
Luke 3:10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
Luke 3:12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
Luke 3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
Luke 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
Luke 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
Luke 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
Luke 3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
Luke 3:20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to

Luke 3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there

Luke 3:25 Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and
Luke 3:26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was

Luke 3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth
Luke 3:32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
Luke 3:33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God

Luke 4:1 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Luke 4:4 And he must needs go through Samaria.
Luke 4:5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
Luke 4:6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
Luke 4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto
Luke 4:8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 4:9
Luke 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
Luke 4:11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
Luke 4:12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,
Luke 4:15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
Luke 4:16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
Luke 4:17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto
Luke 4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
Luke 4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
Luke 4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
Luke 4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
Luke 4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
Luke 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
Luke 4:25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
Luke 4:26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
Luke 4:27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
Luke 4:31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
Luke 4:32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
Luke 4:33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought
Luke 4:35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
Luke 4:36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
Luke 4:37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
Luke 4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men
Luke 4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
Luke 4:40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
Luke 4:41 And many more believed because of his own word; 4:42
Luke 4:42 And said
Luke 4:43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
Luke 4:44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
Luke 4:45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
Luke 4:46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
Luke 4:47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
Luke 4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
Luke 4:49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
Luke 4:50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
Luke 4:51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
Luke 4:52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
Luke 4:53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
Luke 4:54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come
Luke 5:1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
Luke 5:2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
Luke 5:3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
Luke 5:4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
Luke 5:5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
Luke 5:6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
Luke 5:8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
Luke 5:9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
Luke 5:10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
Luke 5:11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
Luke 5:12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
Luke 5:14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
Luke 5:15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had

Luke 5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
Luke 5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
Luke 5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
Luke 5:20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
Luke 5:21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
Luke 5:22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
Luke 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
Luke 5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
Luke 5:26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
Luke 5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
Luke 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
Luke 5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
Luke 5:32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
Luke 5:33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
Luke 5:34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
Luke 5:35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
Luke 5:36 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which
Luke 5:37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of
Luke 5:38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,
Luke 5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:
Luke 5:40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
Luke 5:41 I receive not honour from men.
Luke 5:42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
Luke 5:43 I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another
Luke 5:44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek
Luke 5:46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he

Luke 6:2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
Luke 6:3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
Luke 6:4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
Luke 6:5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
Luke 6:7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
Luke 6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto
Luke 6:11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
Luke 6:12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
Luke 6:13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
Luke 6:14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
Luke 6:15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
Luke 6:16 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
Luke 6:17 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
Luke 6:18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
Luke 6:19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
Luke 6:20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
Luke 6:21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
Luke 6:22 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
Luke 6:23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
Luke 6:25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
Luke 6:27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
Luke 6:28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
Luke 6:30 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
Luke 6:32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
Luke 6:33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
Luke 6:34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
Luke 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
Luke 6:36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
Luke 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
Luke 6:38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
Luke 6:39 And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all
Luke 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
Luke 6:41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
Luke 6:42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
Luke 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
Luke 6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
Luke 6:46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,
Luke 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
Luke 6:48 I am that bread of life.
Luke 6:49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
Luke 6:50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
Luke 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat
Luke 6:52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
Luke 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;
Luke 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
Luke 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
Luke 6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so
Luke 6:58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
Luke 6:59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
Luke 6:60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,
Luke 6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from
Luke 6:65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto
Luke 6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
Luke 6:67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 6:68
Luke 6:68 Then
Luke 6:69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of
Luke 6:70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
Luke 7:1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk
Luke 7:2 Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand.
Luke 7:3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Luke 7:4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
Luke 7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.
Luke 7:6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
Luke 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of
Luke 7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my
Luke 7:9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
Luke 7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
Luke 7:11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
Luke 7:12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for
Luke 7:13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
Luke 7:14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
Luke 7:15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
Luke 7:17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
Luke 7:18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
Luke 7:19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
Luke 7:22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of
Luke 7:23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
Luke 7:25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
Luke 7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no
Luke 7:28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
Luke 7:29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
Luke 7:30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
Luke 7:31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
Luke 7:32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
Luke 7:33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
Luke 7:34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
Luke 7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
Luke 7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
Luke 7:39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
Luke 7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come
Luke 7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on
Luke 7:45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
Luke 7:47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 7:48
Luke 7:50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being
Luke 7:53 And every man went unto his own house.
Luke 8:1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
Luke 8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all
Luke 8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
Luke 8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but
Luke 8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
Luke 8:8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
Luke 8:9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
Luke 8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
Luke 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
Luke 8:13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
Luke 8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
Luke 8:15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
Luke 8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but
Luke 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
Luke 8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
Luke 8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
Luke 8:20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
Luke 8:21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
Luke 8:22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
Luke 8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye
Luke 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if
Luke 8:25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
Luke 8:26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent
Luke 8:27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
Luke 8:28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,
Luke 8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
Luke 8:30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.
Luke 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
Luke 8:33 They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in
Luke 8:35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
Luke 8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
Luke 8:37 I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me,
Luke 8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
Luke 8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
Luke 8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,
Luke 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not
Luke 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:
Luke 8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear
Luke 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye
Luke 8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
Luke 8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
Luke 8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
Luke 8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
Luke 8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
Luke 8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
Luke 8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
Luke 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
Luke 8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
Luke 8:59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
Luke 9:1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
Luke 9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
Luke 9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
Luke 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
Luke 9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
Luke 9:7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
Luke 9:8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that
Luke 9:10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 9:11
Luke 9:12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
Luke 9:13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
Luke 9:14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
Luke 9:15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
Luke 9:16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
Luke 9:17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that
Luke 9:18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
Luke 9:19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
Luke 9:21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
Luke 9:22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for
Luke 9:23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
Luke 9:24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
Luke 9:25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:
Luke 9:26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he
Luke 9:29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know
Luke 9:30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
Luke 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
Luke 9:32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
Luke 9:33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
Luke 9:34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
Luke 9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
Luke 9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
Luke 9:39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
Luke 9:40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,
Luke 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
Luke 10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
Luke 10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
Luke 10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
Luke 10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
Luke 10:6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
Luke 10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Luke 10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
Luke 10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
Luke 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
Luke 10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
Luke 10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
Luke 10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
Luke 10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
Luke 10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
Luke 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I
Luke 10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
Luke 10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
Luke 10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
Luke 10:20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
Luke 10:23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
Luke 10:24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
Luke 10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
Luke 10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
Luke 10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
Luke 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
Luke 10:29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
Luke 10:30 I and my Father are one.
Luke 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
Luke 10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
Luke 10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
Luke 10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
Luke 10:39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
Luke 10:41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
Luke 10:42 And many believed on him there.
Luke 11:1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
Luke 11:2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
Luke 11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
Luke 11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
Luke 11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
Luke 11:7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
Luke 11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
Luke 11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
Luke 11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
Luke 11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
Luke 11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
Luke 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
Luke 11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent
Luke 11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow
Luke 11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
Luke 11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
Luke 11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
Luke 11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
Luke 11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
Luke 11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
Luke 11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
Luke 11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
Luke 11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
Luke 11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
Luke 11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
Luke 11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
Luke 11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
Luke 11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
Luke 11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
Luke 11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
Luke 11:35 Jesus wept.
Luke 11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 11:37
Luke 11:37 And some of
Luke 11:39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
Luke 11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
Luke 11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
Luke 11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Luke 11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
Luke 11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
Luke 11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
Luke 11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
Luke 11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
Luke 11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
Luke 11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
Luke 11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
Luke 11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
Luke 11:55 And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
Luke 11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
Luke 12:1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
Luke 12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
Luke 12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
Luke 12:4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,
Luke 12:7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
Luke 12:8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
Luke 12:9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
Luke 12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
Luke 12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
Luke 12:14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
Luke 12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when
Luke 12:17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
Luke 12:18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that
Luke 12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
Luke 12:20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
Luke 12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
Luke 12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
Luke 12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
Luke 12:25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
Luke 12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
Luke 12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
Luke 12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
Luke 12:29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
Luke 12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
Luke 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
Luke 12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
Luke 12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.
Luke 12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
Luke 12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
Luke 12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
Luke 12:41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
Luke 12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
Luke 12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
Luke 12:45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
Luke 12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
Luke 12:47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
Luke 12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
Luke 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
Luke 12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
Luke 13:1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
Luke 13:2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
Luke 13:5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
Luke 13:6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
Luke 13:8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
Luke 13:9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
Luke 13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
Luke 13:11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not
Luke 13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
Luke 13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
Luke 13:15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
Luke 13:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than
Luke 13:17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
Luke 13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
Luke 13:19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
Luke 13:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
Luke 13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
Luke 13:22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
Luke 13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom
Luke 13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
Luke 13:25 He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
Luke 13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
Luke 13:27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
Luke 13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
Luke 13:29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
Luke 13:30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
Luke 13:31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
Luke 13:32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
Luke 13:33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek
Luke 13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as
Luke 13:35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
Luke 13:36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
Luke 13:37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
Luke 13:38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
Luke 14:1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
Luke 14:2 In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
Luke 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
Luke 14:4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
Luke 14:5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
Luke 14:7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
Luke 14:8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
Luke 14:9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet
Luke 14:11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or
Luke 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
Luke 14:13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
Luke 14:14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
Luke 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
Luke 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Luke 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
Luke 14:19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
Luke 14:20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
Luke 14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
Luke 14:22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
Luke 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which
Luke 14:25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.
Luke 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
Luke 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
Luke 14:28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
Luke 14:29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is
Luke 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
Luke 14:31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
Luke 15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
Luke 15:2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
Luke 15:3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
Luke 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
Luke 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I
Luke 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
Luke 15:7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
Luke 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
Luke 15:9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in
Luke 15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
Luke 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
Luke 15:12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
Luke 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
Luke 15:14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
Luke 15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
Luke 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
Luke 15:17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.
Luke 15:18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
Luke 15:19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
Luke 15:20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
Luke 15:21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,
Luke 15:22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
Luke 15:23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
Luke 15:24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,
Luke 15:25 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
Luke 15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
Luke 16:1 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
Luke 16:2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
Luke 16:3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
Luke 16:4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
Luke 16:5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
Luke 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
Luke 16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
Luke 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
Luke 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
Luke 16:14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
Luke 16:15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that
Luke 16:16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
Luke 16:17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
Luke 16:19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
Luke 16:21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
Luke 16:22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and
Luke 16:23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
Luke 16:24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
Luke 16:25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
Luke 16:26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
Luke 16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,
Luke 16:29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
Luke 16:30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
Luke 16:31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 16:32
Luke 16:32 Behold, the hour
Luke 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
Luke 17:1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
Luke 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
Luke 17:4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
Luke 17:5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
Luke 17:6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
Luke 17:7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
Luke 17:8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
Luke 17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
Luke 17:10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
Luke 17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
Luke 17:12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
Luke 17:13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
Luke 17:14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
Luke 17:15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
Luke 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
Luke 17:17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
Luke 17:18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
Luke 17:19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
Luke 17:20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
Luke 17:22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
Luke 17:24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
Luke 17:25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
Luke 17:26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
Luke 18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
Luke 18:2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
Luke 18:3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the
Luke 18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
Luke 18:6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
Luke 18:7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
Luke 18:8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
Luke 18:10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
Luke 18:11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
Luke 18:14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
Luke 18:15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
Luke 18:16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
Luke 18:17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
Luke 18:18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
Luke 18:19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
Luke 18:20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
Luke 18:21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
Luke 18:22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
Luke 18:25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
Luke 18:26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose
Luke 18:27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
Luke 18:28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and
Luke 18:29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring
Luke 18:31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
Luke 18:33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
Luke 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
Luke 18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
Luke 18:38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
Luke 18:39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
Luke 19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
Luke 19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
Luke 19:4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I
Luke 19:5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
Luke 19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
Luke 19:8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
Luke 19:9 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
Luke 19:10 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
Luke 19:12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
Luke 19:13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
Luke 19:14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth
Luke 19:16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
Luke 19:17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
Luke 19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
Luke 19:20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
Luke 19:21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
Luke 19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
Luke 19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his

Luke 19:25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
Luke 19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
Luke 19:27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that
Luke 19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
Luke 19:29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
Luke 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
Luke 19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
Luke 19:32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of
Luke 19:33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
Luke 19:35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
Luke 19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be
Luke 19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
Luke 19:38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
Luke 19:39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus
Luke 19:40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
Luke 19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
Luke 19:42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation
Luke 20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
Luke 20:2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
Luke 20:3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to
Luke 20:4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
Luke 20:5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
Luke 20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
Luke 20:8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
Luke 20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
Luke 20:10 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
Luke 20:11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
Luke 20:13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
Luke 20:14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
Luke 20:15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
Luke 20:16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
Luke 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
Luke 20:18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
Luke 20:19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
Luke 20:20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
Luke 20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
Luke 20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
Luke 20:24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
Luke 20:25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
Luke 20:26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
Luke 20:27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
Luke 20:28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.
Luke 20:29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
Luke 20:30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
Luke 21:1 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
Luke 21:2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
Luke 21:3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,
Luke 21:4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but
Luke 21:5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
Luke 21:6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
Luke 21:7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
Luke 21:8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not
Luke 21:9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
Luke 21:10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
Luke 21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
Luke 21:12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
Luke 21:13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
Luke 21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
Luke 21:15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
Luke 21:16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
Luke 21:17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
Luke 21:18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
Luke 21:19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
Luke 21:20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
Luke 21:23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
Luke 21:24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
Luke 21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,
Luke 1:1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
Luke 1:5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
Luke 1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
Luke 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
Luke 1:9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
Luke 1:10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
Luke 1:12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
Luke 1:13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
Luke 1:14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
Luke 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
Luke 1:17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
Luke 1:18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
Luke 1:19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as
Luke 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
Luke 1:21 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time
Luke 1:23 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Luke 1:24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
Luke 1:26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
Luke 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
Luke 2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
Luke 2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
Luke 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
Luke 2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
Luke 2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
Luke 2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Luke 2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
Luke 2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
Luke 2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17
Luke 2:17 And
Luke 2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
Luke 2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
Luke 2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me
Luke 2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
Luke 2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
Luke 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
Luke 2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
Luke 2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
Luke 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
Luke 2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
Luke 2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
Luke 2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
Luke 2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
Luke 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
Luke 2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
Luke 2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
Luke 2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
Luke 2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
Luke 3:1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
Luke 3:2 And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom
Luke 3:4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on
Luke 3:5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
Luke 3:6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
Luke 3:7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
Luke 3:8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into
Luke 3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 3:10
Luke 3:10 And they
Luke 3:11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the
Luke 3:12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
Luke 3:13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
Luke 3:14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
Luke 3:16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,
Luke 3:17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did
Luke 3:18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
Luke 3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
Luke 3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
Luke 3:22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord
Luke 3:23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear
Luke 3:24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
Luke 3:25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
Luke 3:26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
Luke 4:1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of
Luke 4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
Luke 4:4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number
Luke 4:5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,
Luke 4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
Luke 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
Luke 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
Luke 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
Luke 4:14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they
Luke 4:15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
Luke 4:17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
Luke 4:18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
Luke 4:19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
Luke 4:20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
Luke 4:21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
Luke 4:22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
Luke 4:23 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
Luke 4:24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
Luke 4:27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
Luke 4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
Luke 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
Luke 4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of
Luke 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
Luke 4:34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
Luke 4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
Luke 5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
Luke 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
Luke 5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
Luke 5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:
Luke 5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
Luke 5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
Luke 5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
Luke 5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
Luke 5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
Luke 5:11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
Luke 5:12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
Luke 5:13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people
Luke 5:14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
Luke 5:16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
Luke 5:17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
Luke 5:19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
Luke 5:21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in
Luke 5:22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
Luke 5:24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
Luke 5:25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
Luke 5:26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
Luke 5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council:
Luke 5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
Luke 5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
Luke 5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
Luke 5:32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy

Luke 5:34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Luke 5:36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
Luke 5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
Luke 5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
Luke 5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
Luke 5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
Luke 5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
Luke 6:1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
Luke 6:2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
Luke 6:3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
Luke 6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
Luke 6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
Luke 6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
Luke 6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
Luke 6:9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
Luke 6:10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
Luke 6:11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
Luke 6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
Luke 6:13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
Luke 6:15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw
Luke 7:1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 7:2
Luke 7:2 And he said,
Luke 7:4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
Luke 7:5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
Luke 7:6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
Luke 7:7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
Luke 7:8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
Luke 7:9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but
Luke 7:11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
Luke 7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
Luke 7:13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
Luke 7:14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
Luke 7:15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
Luke 7:16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that

Luke 7:19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our

Luke 7:22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
Luke 7:23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to
Luke 7:24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
Luke 7:26 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
Luke 7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 7:29
Luke 7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
Luke 7:31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
Luke 7:33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for
Luke 7:34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
Luke 7:35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
Luke 7:36 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs
Luke 7:37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
Luke 7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
Luke 7:41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
Luke 7:42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
Luke 7:44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as
Luke 7:45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into
Luke 7:47 But Solomon built him an house.
Luke 7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
Luke 7:52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they
Luke 7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
Luke 7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
Luke 7:57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
Luke 7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
Luke 7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not
Luke 8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was
Luke 8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great

Luke 8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
Luke 8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
Luke 8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
Luke 8:8 And there was great joy in that city.
Luke 8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
Luke 8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
Luke 8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
Luke 8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
Luke 8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
Luke 8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands
Luke 8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
Luke 8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is
Luke 8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
Luke 8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
Luke 8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
Luke 8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Luke 8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
Luke 8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
Luke 8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
Luke 8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
Luke 8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
Luke 8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
Luke 8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
Luke 8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
Luke 8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down
Luke 8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
Luke 8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
Luke 9:1 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
Luke 9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
Luke 9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
Luke 9:7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
Luke 9:8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
Luke 9:9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
Luke 9:10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
Luke 9:11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which
Luke 9:13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
Luke 9:15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
Luke 9:17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting
Luke 9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
Luke 9:19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
Luke 9:20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is
Luke 9:21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
Luke 9:23 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
Luke 9:25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
Luke 9:26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
Luke 9:27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
Luke 9:28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
Luke 9:29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
Luke 9:30 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,
Luke 9:31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
Luke 9:32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he
Luke 9:33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his
Luke 9:34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
Luke 9:35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
Luke 9:36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
Luke 9:37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died:
Luke 9:38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
Luke 9:39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
Luke 9:40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
Luke 9:41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
Luke 9:42 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
Luke 9:43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
Luke 10:1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
Luke 10:3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
Luke 10:4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,
Luke 10:5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
Luke 10:7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
Luke 10:9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto
Luke 10:13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
Luke 10:14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
Luke 10:15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
Luke 10:16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
Luke 10:17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
Luke 10:19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
Luke 10:20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
Luke 10:21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
Luke 10:23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
Luke 10:24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
Luke 10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at
Luke 10:26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
Luke 10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were
Luke 10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
Luke 10:29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
Luke 10:32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
Luke 10:33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
Luke 10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
Luke 10:36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
Luke 10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
Luke 10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41
Luke 10:42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
Luke 10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
Luke 10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
Luke 10:45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as
Luke 10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
Luke 11:1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
Luke 11:2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
Luke 11:4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
Luke 11:7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
Luke 11:8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at
Luke 11:9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
Luke 11:10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into
Luke 11:11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto
Luke 11:12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
Luke 11:15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
Luke 11:16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
Luke 11:17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,
Luke 11:19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
Luke 11:20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they
Luke 11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
Luke 11:22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
Luke 11:23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
Luke 11:24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
Luke 11:25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26
Luke 11:26 And
Luke 11:27 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
Luke 11:28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
Luke 11:29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
Luke 11:30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
Luke 12:1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
Luke 12:2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
Luke 12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
Luke 12:5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
Luke 12:6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter
Luke 12:7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
Luke 12:8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
Luke 12:9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
Luke 12:10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
Luke 12:11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
Luke 12:12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
Luke 12:13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
Luke 12:14 And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for
Luke 12:15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
Luke 12:16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,
Luke 12:17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
Luke 12:18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
Luke 12:19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
Luke 12:20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
Luke 12:21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
Luke 12:22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
Luke 12:23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
Luke 12:24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Luke 12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
Luke 13:1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
Luke 13:2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
Luke 13:3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
Luke 13:4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
Luke 13:5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in
Luke 13:6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
Luke 13:7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
Luke 13:8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
Luke 13:9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,
Luke 13:10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of
Luke 13:12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
Luke 13:13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
Luke 13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
Luke 13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
Luke 13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
Luke 13:17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
Luke 13:18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
Luke 13:19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
Luke 13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
Luke 13:21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
Luke 13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be
Luke 13:23 Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
Luke 13:25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I
Luke 13:26 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
Luke 13:27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
Luke 13:28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
Luke 13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
Luke 13:30 But God raised him from the dead: 13:31
Luke 13:31 And he was seen many
Luke 13:32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which
Luke 13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
Luke 13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
Luke 13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
Luke 13:37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
Luke 13:38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
Luke 13:40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in
Luke 13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
Luke 13:43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
Luke 13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
Luke 13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
Luke 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
Luke 13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be
Luke 13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
Luke 13:49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
Luke 13:50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
Luke 13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came
Luke 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
Luke 14:1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into
Luke 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
Luke 14:3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
Luke 14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the
Luke 14:5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
Luke 14:8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
Luke 14:11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
Luke 14:12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
Luke 14:13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
Luke 14:14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent
Luke 14:17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
Luke 14:18 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
Luke 14:19 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
Luke 14:20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and
Luke 14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
Luke 14:23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
Luke 14:24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
Luke 14:25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
Luke 14:27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
Luke 14:28 And there they abode long time with the disciples.
Luke 15:1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,
Luke 15:2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
Luke 15:3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
Luke 15:4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the
Luke 15:5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
Luke 15:6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
Luke 15:7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
Luke 15:8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them
Luke 15:10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
Luke 15:11 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
Luke 15:12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
Luke 15:13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men
Luke 15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
Luke 15:16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
Luke 15:18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
Luke 15:19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
Luke 15:21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
Luke 15:22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
Luke 15:24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us
Luke 15:25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
Luke 15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you
Luke 15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
Luke 15:30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they
Luke 15:32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
Luke 15:33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
Luke 15:34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
Luke 15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
Luke 15:36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
Luke 15:37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
Luke 15:38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
Luke 15:39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
Luke 15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Luke 16:1 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple
Luke 16:3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
Luke 16:4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
Luke 16:5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
Luke 16:6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
Luke 16:8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
Luke 16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
Luke 16:10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to
Luke 16:11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
Luke 16:13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
Luke 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
Luke 16:15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
Luke 16:16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
Luke 16:18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and
Luke 16:19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,
Luke 16:22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
Luke 16:23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
Luke 16:25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
Luke 16:26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
Luke 16:27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
Luke 16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
Luke 16:29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
Luke 16:32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
Luke 16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
Luke 16:34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
Luke 16:35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
Luke 16:36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
Luke 16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
Luke 16:38 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
Luke 16:39 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
Luke 16:40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
Luke 17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
Luke 17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
Luke 17:5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
Luke 17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
Luke 17:8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
Luke 17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
Luke 17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
Luke 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
Luke 17:12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
Luke 17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
Luke 17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
Luke 17:15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
Luke 17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
Luke 17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
Luke 17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
Luke 17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
Luke 17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
Luke 17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
Luke 17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
Luke 17:25 Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any
Luke 17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
Luke 17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
Luke 17:32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
Luke 17:33 So Paul departed from among them.
Luke 17:34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
Luke 18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
Luke 18:3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
Luke 18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the
Luke 18:5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
Luke 18:6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
Luke 18:7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house,
Luke 18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
Luke 18:9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
Luke 18:11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word
Luke 18:12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
Luke 18:14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
Luke 18:16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.
Luke 18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
Luke 18:18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
Luke 18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
Luke 18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
Luke 18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
Luke 18:23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
Luke 18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
Luke 18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
Luke 18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
Luke 18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
Luke 19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
Luke 19:3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
Luke 19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
Luke 19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Luke 19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
Luke 19:7 And all the men were about twelve.
Luke 19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
Luke 19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
Luke 19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
Luke 19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 19:12
Luke 19:12 So
Luke 19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
Luke 19:14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
Luke 19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
Luke 19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Luke 19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
Luke 19:19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
Luke 19:20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
Luke 19:21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when
Luke 19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
Luke 19:23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
Luke 19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
Luke 19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and
Luke 19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
Luke 19:28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
Luke 19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
Luke 19:30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
Luke 19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
Luke 19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
Luke 19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
Luke 19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
Luke 19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men
Luke 19:37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
Luke 19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
Luke 19:39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
Luke 19:40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s
Luke 19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Luke 20:1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
Luke 20:2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
Luke 20:4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
Luke 20:5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.
Luke 20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
Luke 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
Luke 20:8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
Luke 20:9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
Luke 20:10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
Luke 20:11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
Luke 20:12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
Luke 20:13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
Luke 20:14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
Luke 20:15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
Luke 20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not
Luke 20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
Luke 20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from
Luke 20:22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
Luke 20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
Luke 20:25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
Luke 20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
Luke 20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
Luke 20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
Luke 20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
Luke 20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
Luke 20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years
Luke 20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
Luke 20:33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Luke 20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
Luke 20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
Luke 20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
Luke 20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
Luke 20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
Luke 21:1 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
Luke 21:3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
Luke 21:4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to
Luke 21:5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
Luke 21:6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
Luke 21:7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
Luke 21:8 And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and
Luke 21:9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
Luke 21:10 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
Luke 21:11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
Luke 21:12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
Luke 21:13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
Luke 21:14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
Luke 21:15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
Luke 21:16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
Luke 21:17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
Luke 21:18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
Luke 21:19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
Luke 21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
Luke 21:22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
Luke 21:23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
Luke 21:25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
Luke 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with
Luke 21:27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
Luke 21:29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Luke 21:30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
Luke 21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
Luke 21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
Luke 21:33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
Luke 21:34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and
Luke 21:35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
Luke 21:36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
Luke 21:37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
Luke 21:40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
Luke 22:2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
Luke 22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
Luke 22:5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
Luke 22:6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
Luke 22:7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
Luke 22:9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
Luke 22:10 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
Luke 22:11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led
Luke 22:12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
Luke 22:14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
Luke 22:15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
Luke 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away
Luke 22:17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
Luke 22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
Luke 22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto
Luke 22:22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
Luke 22:23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
Luke 22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
Luke 22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
Luke 22:28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this
Luke 22:29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
Luke 22:30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
Luke 23:1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
Luke 23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
Luke 23:3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall:
Luke 23:6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
Luke 23:7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
Luke 23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
Luke 23:9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
Luke 23:10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
Luke 23:11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
Luke 23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
Luke 23:13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Luke 23:14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
Luke 23:15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
Luke 23:16 And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he
Luke 23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
Luke 23:18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said,
Luke 23:19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
Luke 23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
Luke 23:21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
Luke 23:22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged
Luke 23:23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
Luke 23:25 And he wrote a letter after this manner: 23:26
Luke 23:26 Claudius Lysias
Luke 23:27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
Luke 23:28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
Luke 23:30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
Luke 23:31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
Luke 23:32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
Luke 23:34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
Luke 24:1 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
Luke 24:2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
Luke 24:4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
Luke 24:5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
Luke 24:7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
Luke 24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
Luke 24:10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
Luke 24:11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
Luke 24:12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
Luke 24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call
Luke 24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
Luke 24:17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
Luke 24:18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
Luke 24:19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had
Luke 24:20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
Luke 24:22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge
Luke 24:23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
Luke 24:24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
Luke 24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
Luke 24:26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
Luke 24:27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and
Luke 25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
Luke 25:2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
Luke 25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
Luke 25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
Luke 25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
Luke 25:7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
Luke 25:8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
Luke 25:9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
Luke 25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
Luke 25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
Luke 25:13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Luke 25:14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s
Luke 25:16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
Luke 25:17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
Luke 25:18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
Luke 25:20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
Luke 25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
Luke 25:22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
Luke 25:23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
Luke 25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
Luke 25:25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
Luke 25:26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore
Luke 25:27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
Luke 26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
Luke 26:4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
Luke 26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
Luke 26:8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
Luke 26:10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
Luke 26:11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
Luke 26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
Luke 26:14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
Luke 26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
Luke 26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee
Luke 26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
Luke 26:21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
Luke 26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
Luke 26:24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Luke 26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
Luke 26:26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
Luke 26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
Luke 26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Luke 26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
Luke 26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
Luke 26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
Luke 27:1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
Luke 27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to
Luke 27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
Luke 27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
Luke 27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
Luke 27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into
Luke 27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
Luke 27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
Luke 27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
Luke 27:12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
Luke 27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
Luke 27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
Luke 27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
Luke 27:16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
Luke 27:18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
Luke 27:20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
Luke 27:21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,
Luke 27:22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no
Luke 27:23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
Luke 27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
Luke 27:26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
Luke 27:27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
Luke 27:29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
Luke 27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they
Luke 27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
Luke 27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
Luke 27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
Luke 27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
Luke 27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
Luke 27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
Luke 27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
Luke 27:39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
Luke 27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
Luke 27:41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
Luke 27:42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of
Luke 27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their

Luke 28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
Luke 28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
Luke 28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
Luke 28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
Luke 28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
Luke 28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
Luke 28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
Luke 28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
Luke 28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
Luke 28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
Luke 28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
Luke 28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
Luke 28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
Luke 28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
Luke 28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
Luke 28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
Luke 28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and
Luke 28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
Luke 28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
Luke 28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
Luke 28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
Luke 28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after
Luke 28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
Luke 28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
Luke 28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
Luke 1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
Luke 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
Luke 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
Luke 1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
Luke 1:13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
Luke 1:14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
Luke 1:15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
Luke 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
Luke 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
Luke 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
Luke 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
Luke 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 1:23
Luke 1:23 And
Luke 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
Luke 1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
Luke 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
Luke 1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
Luke 2:1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
Luke 2:2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
Luke 2:3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
Luke 2:12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
Luke 2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
Luke 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
Luke 2:17 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
Luke 2:21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
Luke 2:25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
Luke 2:26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
Luke 3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
Luke 3:3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
Luke 3:5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
Luke 3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
Luke 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 3:11
Luke 3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
Luke 3:13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
Luke 3:19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
Luke 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
Luke 3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
Luke 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
Luke 3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
Luke 3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
Luke 3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?
Luke 3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
Luke 4:1 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to
Luke 4:3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
Luke 4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but
Luke 4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
Luke 4:6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
Luke 4:8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
Luke 4:9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon
Luke 4:10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
Luke 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
Luke 4:13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not
Luke 4:14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
Luke 4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end
Luke 4:18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
Luke 4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
Luke 4:22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Luke 4:23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
Luke 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
Luke 5:3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
Luke 5:6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
Luke 5:7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
Luke 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
Luke 5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
Luke 5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
Luke 5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Luke 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
Luke 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
Luke 5:15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
Luke 5:16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
Luke 5:17 For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they
Luke 5:19 For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by
Luke 5:20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
Luke 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
Luke 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
Luke 6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.
Luke 6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
Luke 6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
Luke 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
Luke 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
Luke 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
Luke 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
Luke 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
Luke 6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
Luke 6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
Luke 6:19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
Luke 6:20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
Luke 6:21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
Luke 6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
Luke 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
Luke 7:1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
Luke 7:3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
Luke 7:4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the
Luke 7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
Luke 7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
Luke 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
Luke 7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
Luke 7:9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
Luke 7:10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
Luke 7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
Luke 7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
Luke 7:13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
Luke 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
Luke 7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not;
Luke 7:16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that
Luke 7:17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
Luke 7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
Luke 7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
Luke 7:20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
Luke 7:21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
Luke 7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 7:23
Luke 7:23 But I
Luke 7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
Luke 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Luke 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
Luke 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
Luke 8:5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
Luke 8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
Luke 8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
Luke 8:8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Luke 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
Luke 8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
Luke 8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
Luke 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
Luke 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
Luke 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
Luke 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
Luke 8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
Luke 8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
Luke 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
Luke 8:20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
Luke 8:22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
Luke 8:23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
Luke 8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
Luke 8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
Luke 8:27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
Luke 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that
Luke 8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
Luke 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom
Luke 8:31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
Luke 8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
Luke 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
Luke 8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
Luke 8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
Luke 8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
Luke 9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
Luke 9:3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
Luke 9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
Luke 9:8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not
Luke 9:9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
Luke 9:10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
Luke 9:13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
Luke 9:14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
Luke 9:15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
Luke 9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
Luke 9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
Luke 9:18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
Luke 9:19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
Luke 9:26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
Luke 9:27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
Luke 9:29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
Luke 9:30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
Luke 9:31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath
Luke 9:32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
Luke 10:1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
Luke 10:2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
Luke 10:3 For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about
Luke 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
Luke 10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That
Luke 10:6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
Luke 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
Luke 10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
Luke 10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
Luke 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
Luke 10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
Luke 10:18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
Luke 10:19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
Luke 10:20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
Luke 10:21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
Luke 11:1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also
Luke 11:2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not
Luke 11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
Luke 11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
Luke 11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is
Luke 11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
Luke 11:8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
Luke 11:9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and
Luke 11:11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
Luke 11:12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
Luke 11:15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
Luke 11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
Luke 11:19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
Luke 11:20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
Luke 11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which
Luke 11:23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
Luke 11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
Luke 11:26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
Luke 11:28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
Luke 11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
Luke 11:30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
Luke 11:32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
Luke 11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
Luke 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
Luke 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
Luke 12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
Luke 12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
Luke 12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
Luke 12:9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
Luke 12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
Luke 12:14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
Luke 12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
Luke 12:16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
Luke 12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
Luke 12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
Luke 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
Luke 12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
Luke 12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Luke 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
Luke 13:2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
Luke 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
Luke 13:5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
Luke 13:6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s
Luke 13:7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
Luke 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
Luke 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
Luke 13:10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
Luke 13:11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
Luke 13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
Luke 13:13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
Luke 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for
Luke 14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
Luke 14:2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is

Luke 14:7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
Luke 14:8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,
Luke 14:9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
Luke 14:10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
Luke 14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
Luke 14:12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Luke 14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
Luke 14:14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
Luke 14:15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
Luke 14:16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17
Luke 14:17 For the kingdom
Luke 14:18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
Luke 14:19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
Luke 14:20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
Luke 14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any

Luke 15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
Luke 15:5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
Luke 15:7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to
Luke 15:8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
Luke 15:9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
Luke 15:10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
Luke 15:11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
Luke 15:12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he
Luke 15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
Luke 15:14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also
Luke 15:15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you
Luke 15:17 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
Luke 15:18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
Luke 15:20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
Luke 15:22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
Luke 15:23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
Luke 15:25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
Luke 15:26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
Luke 15:27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if
Luke 15:28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
Luke 15:29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
Luke 15:30 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake,
Luke 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Luke 16:1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
Luke 16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 16:4
Luke 16:4 Who
Luke 16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
Luke 16:6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
Luke 16:7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,
Luke 16:8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
Luke 16:9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Luke 16:10 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
Luke 16:11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household
Luke 16:12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the
Luke 16:13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Luke 16:14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
Luke 16:15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
Luke 16:16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
Luke 16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
Luke 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
Luke 16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
Luke 16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
Luke 16:21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
Luke 16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Luke 16:23 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus
Luke 16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Luke 16:25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
Luke 1:1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
Luke 1:4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which
Luke 1:9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
Luke 1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Luke 1:11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
Luke 1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I
Luke 1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
Luke 1:16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know
Luke 1:17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
Luke 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
Luke 1:19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
Luke 1:20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of
Luke 1:22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
Luke 1:23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
Luke 1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
Luke 1:26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
Luke 1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
Luke 2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
Luke 2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
Luke 2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
Luke 2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
Luke 2:6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
Luke 2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
Luke 2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
Luke 2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
Luke 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
Luke 2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
Luke 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
Luke 2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
Luke 2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
Luke 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
Luke 3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
Luke 3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
Luke 3:7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
Luke 3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man
Luke 3:9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye
Luke 3:10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
Luke 3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is
Luke 3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
Luke 3:14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
Luke 3:15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he
Luke 3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
Luke 3:18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
Luke 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
Luke 3:20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
Luke 3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
Luke 3:22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
Luke 4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
Luke 4:2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
Luke 4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
Luke 4:4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but
Luke 4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
Luke 4:6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
Luke 4:7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
Luke 4:9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
Luke 4:10 We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
Luke 4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
Luke 4:14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I
Luke 4:15 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have
Luke 4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
Luke 4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
Luke 4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
Luke 4:19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
Luke 4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
Luke 4:21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
Luke 5:2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that
Luke 5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
Luke 5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
Luke 5:9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
Luke 5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
Luke 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
Luke 5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not
Luke 6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before
Luke 6:4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set
Luke 6:5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
Luke 6:7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to
Luke 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
Luke 6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
Luke 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
Luke 6:12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:
Luke 6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
Luke 6:14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us
Luke 6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I
Luke 6:16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
Luke 6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
Luke 6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;
Luke 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
Luke 7:1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for
Luke 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
Luke 7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
Luke 7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
Luke 7:5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
Luke 7:6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
Luke 7:7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath
Luke 7:8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
Luke 7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to
Luke 7:10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
Luke 7:12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife
Luke 7:13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
Luke 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
Luke 7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
Luke 7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
Luke 7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
Luke 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
Luke 7:20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
Luke 7:21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
Luke 7:22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s
Luke 7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
Luke 7:24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with
Luke 7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I
Luke 7:26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I
Luke 7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
Luke 7:28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
Luke 7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that
Luke 7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion
Luke 7:32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
Luke 7:34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
Luke 7:35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
Luke 7:36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
Luke 7:37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
Luke 7:38 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
Luke 7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
Luke 7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
Luke 8:1 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
Luke 8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing
Luke 8:3 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
Luke 8:4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
Luke 8:5 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
Luke 8:7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with
Luke 8:8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we
Luke 8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
Luke 8:10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
Luke 8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
Luke 9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
Luke 9:3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 9:4
Luke 9:4 Have we not
Luke 9:11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if
Luke 9:13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
Luke 9:15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
Luke 9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for
Luke 9:18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I
Luke 9:19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant
Luke 9:20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
Luke 9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
Luke 9:23 And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker
Luke 9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
Luke 9:25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
Luke 9:26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
Luke 10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how
Luke 10:5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
Luke 10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not
Luke 10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
Luke 10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
Luke 10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
Luke 10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
Luke 10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they
Luke 10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
Luke 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
Luke 10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
Luke 10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
Luke 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
Luke 10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
Luke 10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
Luke 10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
Luke 10:23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:
Luke 10:24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.
Luke 10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question
Luke 10:27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
Luke 10:28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
Luke 10:32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
Luke 11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
Luke 11:2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
Luke 11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
Luke 11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
Luke 11:5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
Luke 11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it
Luke 11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
Luke 11:8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
Luke 11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
Luke 11:10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
Luke 11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
Luke 11:12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
Luke 11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
Luke 11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
Luke 11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
Luke 11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
Luke 11:19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
Luke 11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
Luke 11:21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and
Luke 11:22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
Luke 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
Luke 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
Luke 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
Luke 11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
Luke 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
Luke 11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
Luke 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
Luke 11:31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
Luke 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
Luke 11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one
Luke 11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
Luke 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
Luke 12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
Luke 12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
Luke 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
Luke 12:5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
Luke 12:6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
Luke 12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
Luke 12:8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
Luke 12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
Luke 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
Luke 12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.
Luke 12:15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
Luke 12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body? 12:20
Luke 12:20 But
Luke 12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
Luke 12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
Luke 12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
Luke 12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
Luke 12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
Luke 12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
Luke 12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
Luke 12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
Luke 13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
Luke 13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
Luke 13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
Luke 13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
Luke 13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
Luke 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
Luke 13:10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
Luke 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
Luke 13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
Luke 13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
Luke 14:1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
Luke 14:2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,
Luke 14:3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
Luke 14:4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
Luke 14:5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
Luke 14:6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
Luke 14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
Luke 14:11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
Luke 14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
Luke 14:13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
Luke 14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
Luke 14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
Luke 14:16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
Luke 14:18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 14:19
Luke 14:19 Yet
Luke 14:20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
Luke 14:21 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
Luke 14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
Luke 14:23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
Luke 14:26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
Luke 14:27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
Luke 14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
Luke 14:29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
Luke 14:30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
Luke 14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
Luke 14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
Luke 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
Luke 14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
Luke 14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
Luke 14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
Luke 14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
Luke 14:39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
Luke 14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order.
Luke 15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
Luke 15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
Luke 15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
Luke 15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
Luke 15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
Luke 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
Luke 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
Luke 15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
Luke 15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
Luke 15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
Luke 15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
Luke 15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 15:17
Luke 15:17 And
Luke 15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
Luke 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
Luke 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
Luke 15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
Luke 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
Luke 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
Luke 15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
Luke 15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
Luke 15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
Luke 15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
Luke 15:28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
Luke 15:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
Luke 15:32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
Luke 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
Luke 15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
Luke 15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
Luke 15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh
Luke 15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
Luke 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
Luke 15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
Luke 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;
Luke 15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
Luke 15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
Luke 15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is
Luke 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
Luke 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
Luke 15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
Luke 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
Luke 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
Luke 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
Luke 15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
Luke 15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Luke 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
Luke 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
Luke 16:2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
Luke 16:3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
Luke 16:4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
Luke 16:5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
Luke 16:6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that
Luke 16:7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
Luke 16:8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
Luke 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
Luke 16:10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear:
Luke 16:11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
Luke 16:12 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
Luke 16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
Luke 16:14 Let all your things be done with charity.
Luke 16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
Luke 16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Luke 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore
Luke 16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
Luke 16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with
Luke 16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
Luke 16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
Luke 16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Luke 16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Luke 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
Luke 1:3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Luke 1:5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
Luke 1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
Luke 1:7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
Luke 1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
Luke 1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that
Luke 1:13 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
Luke 1:15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that
Luke 1:17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
Luke 1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
Luke 1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
Luke 1:21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
Luke 1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you
Luke 1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
Luke 2:1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to
Luke 2:2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but
Luke 2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
Luke 2:5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
Luke 2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted
Luke 2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
Luke 2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
Luke 2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of
Luke 2:10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
Luke 2:12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and
Luke 2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Luke 2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
Luke 3:1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
Luke 3:4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 3:5
Luke 3:5 Not that we

Luke 3:10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
Luke 3:11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which

Luke 3:15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
Luke 3:16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
Luke 3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,

Luke 4:1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
Luke 4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4
Luke 4:4 In
Luke 4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
Luke 4:6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
Luke 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
Luke 4:8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
Luke 4:11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake,
Luke 4:12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
Luke 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
Luke 4:15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
Luke 4:16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
Luke 4:17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
Luke 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
Luke 5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
Luke 5:4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not
Luke 5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
Luke 5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
Luke 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
Luke 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
Luke 5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we

Luke 5:13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we
Luke 5:14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
Luke 5:16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though
Luke 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
Luke 5:18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
Luke 5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
Luke 5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
Luke 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we

Luke 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what

Luke 6:18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and

Luke 7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we

Luke 7:4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
Luke 7:5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but
Luke 7:6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
Luke 7:8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
Luke 7:9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
Luke 7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
Luke 7:11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
Luke 7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
Luke 7:13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
Luke 7:14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
Luke 7:15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
Luke 7:16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
Luke 8:1 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
Luke 8:3 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
Luke 8:5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
Luke 8:6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
Luke 8:7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
Luke 8:8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
Luke 8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he

Luke 8:11 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
Luke 8:12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
Luke 8:13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14
Luke 8:14 But
Luke 8:16 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
Luke 8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
Luke 8:18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
Luke 8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
Luke 8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
Luke 8:24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of
Luke 9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
Luke 9:3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be
Luke 9:5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
Luke 9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
Luke 9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
Luke 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
Luke 9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
Luke 9:12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
Luke 9:15 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
Luke 10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
Luke 10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
Luke 10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
Luke 10:7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man

Luke 10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we

Luke 10:18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
Luke 11:1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
Luke 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
Luke 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
Luke 11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
Luke 11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
Luke 11:6 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
Luke 11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
Luke 11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
Luke 11:9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to
Luke 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
Luke 11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
Luke 11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from
Luke 11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
Luke 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
Luke 11:15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
Luke 11:16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a
Luke 11:17 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
Luke 11:18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
Luke 11:19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
Luke 11:20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
Luke 11:21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
Luke 11:22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
Luke 11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
Luke 11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
Luke 11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
Luke 11:28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
Luke 11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
Luke 11:30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
Luke 11:31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
Luke 11:32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of
Luke 12:1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to

Luke 12:11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
Luke 12:12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
Luke 12:13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
Luke 12:14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
Luke 12:15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
Luke 12:16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,
Luke 12:17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
Luke 12:18 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a

Luke 13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
Luke 13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
Luke 13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
Luke 13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this

Luke 1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Luke 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
Luke 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
Luke 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
Luke 1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
Luke 1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
Luke 1:12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
Luke 1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
Luke 1:15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,
Luke 1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
Luke 1:19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s
Luke 1:20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
Luke 1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22
Luke 1:22 And
Luke 1:23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
Luke 1:24 And they glorified God in me.
Luke 2:1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Luke 2:2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
Luke 2:3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled

Luke 3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
Luke 3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
Luke 3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
Luke 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
Luke 3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it

Luke 3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
Luke 3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
Luke 3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
Luke 3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
Luke 3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if
Luke 3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
Luke 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto
Luke 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
Luke 3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a

Luke 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Luke 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
Luke 3:29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs
Luke 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
Luke 4:3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
Luke 4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
Luke 4:7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
Luke 4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
Luke 4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
Luke 4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
Luke 4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
Luke 4:13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
Luke 4:14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
Luke 4:15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
Luke 4:16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
Luke 4:17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
Luke 4:18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
Luke 4:19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
Luke 4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
Luke 4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
Luke 4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
Luke 4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Luke 4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
Luke 4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
Luke 4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
Luke 4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
Luke 4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
Luke 4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
Luke 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
Luke 5:2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
Luke 5:3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
Luke 5:4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
Luke 5:5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
Luke 5:6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
Luke 5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
Luke 5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Luke 5:10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
Luke 5:11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
Luke 5:12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Luke 5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
Luke 5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
Luke 5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
Luke 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
Luke 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
Luke 5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Luke 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
Luke 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
Luke 5:24 And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the
Luke 5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Luke 5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
Luke 6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
Luke 6:2 Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Luke 6:3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he

Luke 6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden.
Luke 6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
Luke 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
Luke 6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
Luke 6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall

Luke 6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
Luke 6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
Luke 6:13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
Luke 6:14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Luke 6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
Luke 6:16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
Luke 6:17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
Luke 6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Luke 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
Luke 1:2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
Luke 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
Luke 1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
Luke 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Luke 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
Luke 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
Luke 1:15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
Luke 1:20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
Luke 2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
Luke 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
Luke 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
Luke 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
Luke 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
Luke 2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
Luke 2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
Luke 2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
Luke 2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
Luke 3:1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
Luke 3:8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
Luke 3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
Luke 3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Luke 3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to
Luke 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
Luke 4:1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
Luke 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
Luke 4:7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
Luke 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
Luke 4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
Luke 4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
Luke 4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21
Luke 4:21 If so be that ye have
Luke 4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
Luke 4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
Luke 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
Luke 4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
Luke 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
Luke 4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
Luke 5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2
Luke 5:2 And walk
Luke 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
Luke 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
Luke 5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
Luke 5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
Luke 5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
Luke 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
Luke 5:12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
Luke 5:13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
Luke 5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
Luke 5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
Luke 5:16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Luke 5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
Luke 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
Luke 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
Luke 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Luke 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
Luke 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives
Luke 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
Luke 5:28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
Luke 5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
Luke 5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
Luke 5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
Luke 5:33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
Luke 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Luke 6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
Luke 6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
Luke 6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to
Luke 6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
Luke 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
Luke 6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
Luke 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
Luke 6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
Luke 6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
Luke 6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
Luke 6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
Luke 6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
Luke 6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
Luke 1:1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
Luke 1:3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 1:4
Luke 1:4 Always in every
Luke 1:8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
Luke 1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
Luke 1:11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
Luke 1:12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
Luke 1:15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also
Luke 1:18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
Luke 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
Luke 1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Luke 1:22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet
Luke 1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and
Luke 1:25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
Luke 1:27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
Luke 1:29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
Luke 2:1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
Luke 2:3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
Luke 2:4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
Luke 2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 2:6
Luke 2:6 Who,
Luke 2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
Luke 2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
Luke 2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
Luke 2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
Luke 2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 2:15
Luke 2:15 That ye may
Luke 2:17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
Luke 2:18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
Luke 2:19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
Luke 2:20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
Luke 2:21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
Luke 2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
Luke 2:23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
Luke 2:24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
Luke 2:25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
Luke 2:26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
Luke 2:27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;
Luke 2:28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
Luke 2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
Luke 3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
Luke 3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
Luke 3:3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
Luke 3:4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
Luke 3:6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
Luke 3:7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
Luke 3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
Luke 3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is
Luke 3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
Luke 3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
Luke 3:15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if
Luke 3:16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
Luke 3:17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
Luke 3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
Luke 4:1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
Luke 4:2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
Luke 4:3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
Luke 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
Luke 4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
Luke 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
Luke 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
Luke 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
Luke 4:9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
Luke 4:10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
Luke 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
Luke 4:12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
Luke 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Luke 4:14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with
Luke 4:15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
Luke 4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
Luke 4:17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
Luke 4:18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
Luke 4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
Luke 4:20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Luke 4:21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with
Luke 4:22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s
Luke 4:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Luke 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
Luke 1:3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
Luke 1:4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
Luke 1:5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
Luke 1:6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth
Luke 1:7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you
Luke 1:8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Luke 1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
Luke 1:10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
Luke 1:11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
Luke 1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
Luke 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
Luke 1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
Luke 1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
Luke 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
Luke 1:17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
Luke 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
Luke 1:19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
Luke 1:20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
Luke 1:21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
Luke 1:22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
Luke 1:23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
Luke 1:24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
Luke 1:25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
Luke 1:26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
Luke 1:27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
Luke 1:28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
Luke 1:29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
Luke 2:1 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for
Luke 2:2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
Luke 2:3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Luke 2:4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
Luke 2:5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
Luke 2:6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
Luke 2:7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
Luke 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
Luke 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
Luke 2:10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
Luke 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
Luke 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
Luke 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
Luke 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
Luke 2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
Luke 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
Luke 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
Luke 2:18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
Luke 2:19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
Luke 2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
Luke 2:21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Luke 2:22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
Luke 2:23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
Luke 3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
Luke 3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
Luke 3:3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Luke 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
Luke 3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
Luke 3:6 For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
Luke 3:7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
Luke 3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
Luke 3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
Luke 3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the
Luke 3:11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
Luke 3:12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
Luke 3:13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
Luke 3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
Luke 3:15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
Luke 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
Luke 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Luke 3:18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
Luke 3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
Luke 3:20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing
Luke 3:21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
Luke 3:22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not
Luke 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
Luke 3:24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
Luke 3:25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
Luke 4:1 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing
Luke 4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
Luke 4:3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
Luke 4:4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
Luke 4:5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
Luke 4:6 Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
Luke 4:7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
Luke 4:8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know
Luke 4:9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They
Luke 4:10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son
Luke 4:11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
Luke 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
Luke 4:13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
Luke 4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
Luke 4:15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
Luke 4:16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
Luke 4:17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
Luke 4:18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
Luke 1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Luke 1:2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
Luke 1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
Luke 1:6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
Luke 1:7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
Luke 1:8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
Luke 1:9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
Luke 2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it
Luke 2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
Luke 2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
Luke 2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
Luke 2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
Luke 2:10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
Luke 2:13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
Luke 2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
Luke 2:17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
Luke 2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
Luke 2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
Luke 3:1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
Luke 3:4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
Luke 3:5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
Luke 3:6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
Luke 3:9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
Luke 3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
Luke 4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
Luke 4:2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
Luke 4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
Luke 4:7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
Luke 4:8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
Luke 4:9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:
Luke 4:10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
Luke 4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
Luke 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
Luke 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
Luke 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
Luke 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
Luke 5:1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I

Luke 5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
Luke 5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
Luke 5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
Luke 5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
Luke 5:7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
Luke 5:8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
Luke 5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
Luke 5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
Luke 5:12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
Luke 5:14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
Luke 5:15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
Luke 5:16 Rejoice evermore.
Luke 5:17 Pray without ceasing.
Luke 5:18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
Luke 5:19 Quench not the Spirit.
Luke 5:20 Despise not prophesyings.
Luke 5:21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
Luke 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.
Luke 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
Luke 5:24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
Luke 5:25 Brethren, pray for us.
Luke 5:26 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
Luke 5:27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
Luke 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Luke 1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Luke 1:3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
Luke 1:11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
Luke 2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Luke 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
Luke 2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
Luke 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
Luke 2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
Luke 2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
Luke 2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
Luke 2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
Luke 2:16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
Luke 3:1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
Luke 3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
Luke 3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
Luke 3:5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
Luke 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Luke 3:7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
Luke 3:10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
Luke 3:11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
Luke 3:12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
Luke 3:13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
Luke 3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
Luke 3:15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Luke 3:16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
Luke 3:17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
Luke 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Luke 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Luke 1:3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
Luke 1:5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
Luke 1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9
Luke 1:12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
Luke 1:14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
Luke 1:15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Luke 1:16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus

Luke 1:18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
Luke 2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
Luke 2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
Luke 2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
Luke 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
Luke 2:7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
Luke 2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,

Luke 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over

Luke 3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
Luke 3:10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office
Luke 3:11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
Luke 3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their

Luke 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some

Luke 4:6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
Luke 4:7 But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself
Luke 4:8 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
Luke 4:9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
Luke 4:10 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
Luke 4:11 These things command and teach.
Luke 4:12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
Luke 4:13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
Luke 4:14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
Luke 4:15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
Luke 4:16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:
Luke 5:1 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger
Luke 5:3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.
Luke 5:4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
Luke 5:5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
Luke 5:6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
Luke 5:7 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
Luke 5:8 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
Luke 5:9 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
Luke 5:10 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
Luke 5:11 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
Luke 5:13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
Luke 5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
Luke 5:15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.
Luke 5:16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
Luke 5:17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
Luke 5:18 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
Luke 5:19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or

Luke 5:23 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s
Luke 5:24 Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
Luke 5:25 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
Luke 6:1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
Luke 6:2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
Luke 6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
Luke 6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
Luke 6:7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can

Luke 6:9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and

Luke 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
Luke 1:5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
Luke 1:7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
Luke 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
Luke 1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,
Luke 1:10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
Luke 1:13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
Luke 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
Luke 2:3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
Luke 2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
Luke 2:7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
Luke 2:8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that
Luke 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
Luke 2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
Luke 2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
Luke 2:13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
Luke 2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
Luke 2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their

Luke 2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
Luke 2:18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
Luke 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
Luke 3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
Luke 3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch
Luke 3:4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
Luke 3:5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for
Luke 3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
Luke 3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
Luke 3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) 3:12
Luke 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any
Luke 3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of
Luke 3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that
Luke 3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
Luke 4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering

Luke 4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,
Luke 4:5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
Luke 4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and
Luke 4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after
Luke 4:8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have
Luke 4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
Luke 4:10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
Luke 4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
Luke 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
Luke 4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight:
Luke 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into
Luke 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
Luke 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we

Luke 5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
Luke 5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
Luke 5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
Luke 5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
Luke 5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
Luke 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
Luke 5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
Luke 5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
Luke 5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
Luke 5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
Luke 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us
Luke 6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.
Luke 6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
Luke 6:7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,
Luke 6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things

Luke 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to
Luke 6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by
Luke 6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Luke 6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
Luke 6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
Luke 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
Luke 7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
Luke 7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
Luke 7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
Luke 7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,
Luke 7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
Luke 7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met
Luke 7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
Luke 7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another

Luke 7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of
Luke 7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Luke 7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going

Luke 7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
Luke 7:28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
Luke 8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have
Luke 8:3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
Luke 8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that
Luke 8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
Luke 8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no

Luke 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Luke 8:12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins
Luke 8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now
Luke 9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
Luke 9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
Luke 9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the

Luke 9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,

Luke 9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
Luke 9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
Luke 9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the

Luke 9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the

Luke 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
Luke 10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
Luke 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
Luke 10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
Luke 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are

Luke 10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
Luke 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
Luke 10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
Luke 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
Luke 10:28 He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or

Luke 10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were

Luke 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
Luke 11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Luke 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
Luke 11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Luke 11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
Luke 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
Luke 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
Luke 11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which
Luke 11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange

Luke 11:12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so
Luke 11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but

Luke 11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
Luke 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
Luke 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
Luke 11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
Luke 11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of
Luke 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
Luke 11:24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
Luke 11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
Luke 11:28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,
Luke 11:29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which
Luke 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
Luke 11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed

Luke 11:34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
Luke 11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were
Luke 11:39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,

Luke 12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
Luke 12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
Luke 12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
Luke 12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,
Luke 12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
Luke 12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
Luke 12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man

Luke 12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
Luke 12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped

Luke 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.
Luke 13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
Luke 13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
Luke 13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
Luke 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
Luke 13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
Luke 13:7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
Luke 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
Luke 13:9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is
Luke 13:10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve
Luke 13:11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the

Luke 13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
Luke 13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
Luke 13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
Luke 13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
Luke 13:19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
Luke 13:20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
Luke 13:22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for
Luke 13:23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
Luke 13:24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.
Luke 13:25 Grace be with you all. Amen.

Luke 1:9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10
Luke 1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
Luke 1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
Luke 1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God

Luke 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
Luke 1:26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
Luke 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
Luke 2:1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
Luke 2:2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
Luke 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
Luke 2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
Luke 2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law
Luke 2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
Luke 2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,
Luke 2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
Luke 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
Luke 2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
Luke 2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
Luke 2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
Luke 2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
Luke 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
Luke 3:1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
Luke 3:2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
Luke 3:3 Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us;
Luke 3:4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
Luke 3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
Luke 3:7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
Luke 3:9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we
Luke 3:10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
Luke 3:11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
Luke 3:13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
Luke 3:14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
Luke 3:15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
Luke 3:16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
Luke 3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
Luke 3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
Luke 4:1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
Luke 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
Luke 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
Luke 4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that

Luke 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your

Luke 4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
Luke 4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
Luke 4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
Luke 4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
Luke 4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
Luke 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
Luke 5:1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
Luke 5:2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
Luke 5:3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
Luke 5:4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
Luke 5:5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
Luke 5:6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
Luke 5:7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
Luke 5:8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the
Luke 5:9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
Luke 5:10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
Luke 5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
Luke 5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
Luke 5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him
Luke 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;
Luke 5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
Luke 5:17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
Luke 5:18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
Luke 5:19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
Luke 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
Luke 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
Luke 1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
Luke 1:10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
Luke 1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
Luke 1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
Luke 1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
Luke 1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
Luke 1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
Luke 1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
Luke 1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
Luke 1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
Luke 2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
Luke 2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
Luke 2:6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in

Luke 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
Luke 2:10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
Luke 2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
Luke 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake:
Luke 2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
Luke 2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
Luke 2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to
Luke 2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
Luke 2:20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
Luke 2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
Luke 2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
Luke 3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
Luke 3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
Luke 3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
Luke 3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
Luke 3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
Luke 3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
Luke 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
Luke 3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
Luke 3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
Luke 3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
Luke 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
Luke 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not

Luke 4:7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and
Luke 4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for
Luke 4:9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
Luke 4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
Luke 4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
Luke 4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
Luke 4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
Luke 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
Luke 4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
Luke 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
Luke 5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and
Luke 5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
Luke 5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
Luke 5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he

Luke 5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
Luke 5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
Luke 5:14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
Luke 1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
Luke 1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;
Luke 1:8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
Luke 1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
Luke 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
Luke 1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
Luke 1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
Luke 1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
Luke 1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
Luke 1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there
Luke 1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
Luke 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
Luke 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
Luke 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
Luke 2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
Luke 2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
Luke 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
Luke 2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
Luke 2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
Luke 2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
Luke 2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
Luke 2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
Luke 2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
Luke 2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
Luke 2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The
Luke 3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which
Luke 3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
Luke 3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
Luke 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
Luke 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
Luke 3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
Luke 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
Luke 3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
Luke 3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
Luke 3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
Luke 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
Luke 1:4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
Luke 1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
Luke 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
Luke 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
Luke 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
Luke 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
Luke 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
Luke 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
Luke 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
Luke 2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
Luke 2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
Luke 2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
Luke 2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in
Luke 2:9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
Luke 2:10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
Luke 2:11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
Luke 2:12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
Luke 2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from
Luke 2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that
Luke 2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If
Luke 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
Luke 2:17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
Luke 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
Luke 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
Luke 2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
Luke 2:21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
Luke 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
Luke 2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that
Luke 2:24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
Luke 2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
Luke 2:26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
Luke 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,
Luke 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
Luke 2:29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
Luke 3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
Luke 3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
Luke 3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even
Luke 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
Luke 3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
Luke 3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
Luke 3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
Luke 3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
Luke 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
Luke 3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
Luke 3:11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
Luke 3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
Luke 3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
Luke 3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love
Luke 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
Luke 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
Luke 3:17 But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
Luke 3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
Luke 3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
Luke 3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
Luke 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
Luke 3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
Luke 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
Luke 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
Luke 4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
Luke 4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
Luke 4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
Luke 4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
Luke 4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
Luke 4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
Luke 4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
Luke 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
Luke 4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
Luke 4:12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
Luke 4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
Luke 4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to
Luke 4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
Luke 4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
Luke 4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
Luke 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
Luke 4:19 We love him, because he first loved us.
Luke 4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:
Luke 5:1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
Luke 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
Luke 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
Luke 5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is
Luke 5:5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
Luke 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
Luke 5:8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and
Luke 5:9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
Luke 5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
Luke 5:11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
Luke 5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
Luke 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
Luke 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
Luke 5:16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
Luke 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
Luke 5:18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
Luke 5:19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
Luke 5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
Luke 5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
Luke 1:1 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
Luke 1:3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
Luke 1:4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
Luke 1:5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
Luke 1:6 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
Luke 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
Luke 1:8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
Luke 1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Luke 1:10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
Luke 1:12 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
Luke 1:13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
Luke 1:1 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
Luke 1:2 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
Luke 1:3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of
Luke 1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
Luke 1:5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
Luke 1:8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers
Luke 1:9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the

Luke 1:11 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
Luke 1:12 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:
Luke 1:13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
Luke 1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
Luke 1:3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
Luke 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
Luke 1:5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
Luke 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
Luke 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
Luke 1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
Luke 1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
Luke 1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
Luke 1:11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
Luke 1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
Luke 1:14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
Luke 1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
Luke 1:17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of
Luke 1:19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
Luke 1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
Luke 1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23
Luke 1:23 And others
Luke 1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
Luke 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
Luke 1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
Luke 1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you,
Luke 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
Luke 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
Luke 1:9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
Luke 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a

Luke 1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
Luke 1:16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
Luke 1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his

Luke 2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
Luke 2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
Luke 2:6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
Luke 2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
Luke 2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
Luke 2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 2:12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
Luke 2:14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
Luke 2:15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Luke 2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
Luke 2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 2:18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
Luke 2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
Luke 2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
Luke 2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery
Luke 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
Luke 2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
Luke 2:25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
Luke 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
Luke 2:28 And I will give him the morning star.
Luke 2:29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 3:1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
Luke 3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
Luke 3:3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
Luke 3:4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their

Luke 3:6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 3:7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things
Luke 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they
Luke 3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
Luke 3:11 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no
Luke 3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,
Luke 3:13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 3:14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
Luke 3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
Luke 3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
Luke 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
Luke 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice,
Luke 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
Luke 3:22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Luke 4:1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and
Luke 4:2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set
Luke 4:3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
Luke 4:4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon
Luke 4:5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
Luke 4:6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:
Luke 4:7 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
Luke 4:8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
Luke 4:9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
Luke 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
Luke 5:2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
Luke 5:4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to
Luke 5:5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of
Luke 5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four

Luke 5:13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
Luke 5:14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
Luke 6:1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as
Luke 6:2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a
Luke 6:3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast
Luke 6:4 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given
Luke 6:5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
Luke 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure
Luke 6:7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
Luke 6:8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on
Luke 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
Luke 6:12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
Luke 6:14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
Luke 6:15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
Luke 7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
Luke 7:4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
Luke 7:5 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
Luke 7:6 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
Luke 7:7 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
Luke 7:8 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
Luke 7:9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
Luke 7:11 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
Luke 7:13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
Luke 7:15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
Luke 7:16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
Luke 7:17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
Luke 8:1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
Luke 8:2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
Luke 8:3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
Luke 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
Luke 8:5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
Luke 8:6 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
Luke 8:7 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled
Luke 8:8 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
Luke 8:10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
Luke 8:12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
Luke 8:13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
Luke 9:2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of
Luke 9:3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto
Luke 9:4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
Luke 9:5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
Luke 9:6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
Luke 9:7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
Luke 9:8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as
Luke 9:9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
Luke 9:10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
Luke 9:11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
Luke 9:12 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
Luke 9:13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
Luke 9:15 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour,
Luke 9:16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
Luke 9:17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
Luke 9:18 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and
Luke 9:19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their
Luke 9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
Luke 10:1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
Luke 10:4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
Luke 10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
Luke 10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
Luke 10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little
Luke 10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it
Luke 10:11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
Luke 11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
Luke 11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure
Luke 11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
Luke 11:4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
Luke 11:5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
Luke 11:6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
Luke 11:7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
Luke 11:8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
Luke 11:9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
Luke 11:10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and
Luke 11:11 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
Luke 11:12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
Luke 11:13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
Luke 11:14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
Luke 11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
Luke 11:16 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
Luke 11:18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
Luke 11:19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
Luke 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
Luke 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
Luke 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
Luke 12:5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
Luke 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
Luke 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
Luke 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Luke 12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
Luke 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
Luke 12:12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
Luke 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
Luke 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
Luke 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
Luke 12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
Luke 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
Luke 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
Luke 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet
Luke 13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
Luke 13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:
Luke 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
Luke 13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
Luke 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
Luke 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.
Luke 13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
Luke 13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
Luke 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
Luke 13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
Luke 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that
Luke 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
Luke 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
Luke 14:1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
Luke 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and
Luke 14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
Luke 14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
Luke 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
Luke 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
Luke 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
Luke 14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
Luke 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
Luke 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
Luke 14:14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
Luke 14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
Luke 14:16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
Luke 14:17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
Luke 14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
Luke 14:19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
Luke 14:20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
Luke 15:1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
Luke 15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
Luke 15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
Luke 15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou
Luke 15:5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
Luke 15:7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
Luke 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
Luke 16:1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
Luke 16:2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and
Luke 16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
Luke 16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
Luke 16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
Luke 16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
Luke 16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
Luke 16:8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
Luke 16:9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
Luke 16:10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
Luke 16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
Luke 16:13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
Luke 16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
Luke 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
Luke 16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
Luke 16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
Luke 16:18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
Luke 16:19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
Luke 16:20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
Luke 16:21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
Luke 17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
Luke 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
Luke 17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
Luke 17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
Luke 17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
Luke 17:7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
Luke 17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
Luke 17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven
Luke 17:10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
Luke 17:11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
Luke 17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
Luke 17:13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
Luke 17:14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
Luke 17:15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
Luke 17:16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
Luke 17:17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
Luke 17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
Luke 18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
Luke 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
Luke 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
Luke 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
Luke 18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
Luke 18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
Luke 18:7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
Luke 18:8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning,
Luke 18:9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
Luke 18:11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
Luke 18:14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
Luke 18:15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
Luke 18:16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine
Luke 18:20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
Luke 18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
Luke 18:22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
Luke 18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
Luke 19:1 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
Luke 19:3 And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and
Luke 19:4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
Luke 19:5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all
Luke 19:6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
Luke 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
Luke 19:8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
Luke 19:9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
Luke 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
Luke 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
Luke 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
Luke 19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name
Luke 19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
Luke 19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
Luke 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING
Luke 19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
Luke 19:19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
Luke 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
Luke 19:21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
Luke 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
Luke 20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
Luke 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
Luke 20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
Luke 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
Luke 20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
Luke 20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
Luke 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
Luke 20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
Luke 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
Luke 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
Luke 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
Luke 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
Luke 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
Luke 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
Luke 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
Luke 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
Luke 21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
Luke 21:6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
Luke 21:7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
Luke 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
Luke 21:9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
Luke 21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
Luke 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
Luke 21:15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
Luke 21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
Luke 21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
Luke 21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
Luke 21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
Luke 21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
Luke 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was
Luke 21:22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
Luke 21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
Luke 21:24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
Luke 21:25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
Luke 21:26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
Luke 21:27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
Luke 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
Luke 22:2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
Luke 22:3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
Luke 22:5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
Luke 22:6 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
Luke 22:7 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
Luke 22:8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
Luke 22:9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
Luke 22:10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
Luke 22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
Luke 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
Luke 22:13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and

Luke 22:15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
Luke 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
Luke 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
Luke 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
Luke 22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
Luke 22:21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
